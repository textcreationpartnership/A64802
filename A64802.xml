            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:35177:4"/> looſned from this world (as this Treatiſe fully ſpeaks) ſo much of her ſtrength, ſpirit, affection, and time ſhe ſpent in Cloſet-meetings with God in reading, praying, meditation, ſelf-examination, &amp;c. that it was a wonder her poor weak body was able to ſubſiſt; and doubtleſs, had not God <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſtrength, anointing her with freſh oyle,</hi> it could not have been. I marvelled (I confeſs) to ſee ſo many of her writings found in her Cloſet as I did.</p>
            <p>God gave her a <hi>quick wit,</hi> a <hi>large underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> a <hi>conſidering ſpirit;</hi> and looking much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her ſelf, taught her to put <hi>an high price on ordinances,</hi> made her very <hi>diligent in the uſe of all means</hi> laid her <hi>very low</hi> in her own eyes, with much ſelf-emptineſs; &amp; <hi>thus</hi> beſpoko a la ge room in her heart that he might bestow a great deale of Chriſt therein, and ſo made her a Veſſel capable of a greater meaſure of Grace then (I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) many others (though truly godly) attain on this ſide heaven.</p>
            <p>So exceeding <hi>tender</hi> was her heart in point of ſin, that ſhe would often and deeply judge her ſelf (as this Treatiſe abundantly ſhews) for <hi>pride, paſſion, inordinate love to the creature, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of duty to her relations,</hi> &amp;c. whereas thoſe that daylie converſed with her (being of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſpirits) could ſee no ſuch appearances, but the contrary frame of ſpirit eminently ſhining out
<pb facs="tcp:35177:5"/> in her; ſhe was ſo <hi>afraid of pride,</hi> that ſhe dared not wear ſuch Jewels &amp; apparel as ſhe had by her, for fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>She was ſuch <hi>an high prizer of Ordinances,</hi> that ſhe forgetting the weakneſs of her own body, the length of the way, &amp; many other obſtructons, would frequently break through all to enjoy them; and when ſhe was to hear ſhe firſt was <hi>ful of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to God to meet her therein, and make out ſome diſcoveries to her ſoul, which the Lord uſually did; and ſhe ſtraightly obſerving Gods <hi>incomes,</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with praiſe her deep acknowledgements of the ſame.</p>
            <p>No ſmall importunities of very many godly that knew her, have forced the <hi>publiſhing of this Treatiſe;</hi> and others of long ſtanding in Chriſt and eminent Grace, who have ſeen ſome of it in Manuſcripts, have freely confeſſed they never loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into it but were much humbled to ſoe how ſhort themſelves come in ſuch heart-ſearchings, ſelf-judgings, cloſe-walkings with God, and ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings

               <hi>Anne Venn;</hi> and having had many yeers converſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the great matters of eternal life with her, and injoying her ſociety for ſome yeers in the holy fellowſhip of the goſpel, I could not but preſent to the Saints the ſweet ſavour of her holy wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in which ſhe was a lively example to all that knew her.</p>
            <p>The Lord firſt brake in upon her heart by the frequent impreſſions of the Word as they were inſtilled into her by her honour'd father, whoſe practice was to re-inforce the Truths publikely
<pb facs="tcp:35177:7"/> preached in his Family upon his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants; and by this means this daughter and one of his ſervants were brought home unto the Lord; and which I mention as an alarum to the Saints to the practiſe of this duty, which ſeems in this licentious age to bee ſo greatly neglected. She had this honor to enjoy the indeared affection of all Saints that converſed with her, as being eminent in theſe graces: Firſt, in love to all Saints though of different Judgements; where ſhe diſcerned any characters of Chriſts image, her heart delighted in them, which grace ſhined the more clearly becauſe ſhe lived in a time wherein the contrary evill moſt prevailed.</p>
            <p>Again, ſhe was eminently exemplary in that holy art of the Improvement of the ſociety of the Saints, by ſerious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of prepared queſtions about matters of moſt infinite concernment, with ſuch wiſdom in ſearching out the deepeſt of the Treaſures God had laid
<pb facs="tcp:35177:7"/> up in others hearts; that ſhe grew abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in experimental knowledge of ſaving Truths, and was able and ready to communicate richly unto others.</p>
            <p>She was a moſt diligent Chriſtian in attending all the Ordinances; and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very adminiſtration did hearken what <hi>God</hi> ſaid to her ſoul; and as her ſoule waited for ſome diſcoveries of God, ſo the ſhining forth of God in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and comforts ſhee did abundantly enjoy.</p>
            <p>Shee was a careful Obſerver of the Lords day, and found ſuch profit in the ways of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> that his Day was her delight and ſhe requently was fild in her ſoule as with marrow and fatneſs.</p>
            <p>She was a ſteddy Chriſtian in reeling times, and received nothing for truth but what ſhe would often weigh in the ballance or the Sanctuary, and upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid grounds lay up in her heart, or put forth in her practice.</p>
            <p>And for her diligence and induſtry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:35177:8"/> heavenly things ſhe ſo far abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that whoever hath the ſight of her labours would not eaſily conceive ſo much could be done in one whoſe life was ſo ſhort.</p>
            <p>She wrote her dayly Meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy book of God, which ſhee kept in a book fair written.</p>
            <p>She contracted all ſhe heard in the publike Miniſtry into a method, &amp; in a book in Folio hath fairly tranſcribed ſome part of that work which would have contained the ſubſtance of all the labors of the Miniſters of Chriſt, whoſe Miniſtry ſhe was partaker of: And in another had written all the attributes of God and Chriſt that ſhe could finde in Scripture for the ſtrengthning of the ſaith of beleevers. The truth is, ſhee was a ſoul wholly dedicated to the Lord, and in her whole converſation humble, and holy, and tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>One truly weaned from this world, weary of it, and often breathing out ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:35177:8"/> longings to be with Chriſt, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaying, VVhat is there in this dark world that ſhould cauſe a Chriſtian to deſire to continue in it? And as ſhee longed to be at home, ſo the Lord haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the time, and in her tender yeers gathered her to himſelf. And in her death ſhee ſhewed forth a gracious frame of ſpirit, and with holy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Chriſt reſigned her ſelfe to him.</p>
            <p>And ſuch was het holy jealouſy of any pride or hypocriſy that might ariſe by diſcovering of her labour, that untill ſhee fell aſleep in the Lord her wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings came not to the view of any.</p>
            <p>Thus this bleſſed ſoule walked with the Lord, and theſe things are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her for our example, that we may tread in her ſteps, and be followers of her as he ſhe followed Chriſt, which is the hearty desire of him who is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt and his Church,</p>

               <p>IN the year 1635 when I was yet very young being not (at the moſt) full nine years old, the Lord was pleaſed through the preaching of his word (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) together with my fathers repeating and farther preſſing it home upon our ſpirits, to begin to work upon my heart, and to give in ſome kind of deſires after the beſt things; whereupon I began to take ſome delight in hearing the word, but moſt of all in reading to my ſelf, in which I then ſpent many hours if not whole dayes: the Lord ſetting the one and the other ſo home upon my ſpirit, as to convince me both of my ſinful and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition by reaſon of my continual breach of his holy lawes, and grieving the ſpirit of my parents, the which was much ſet home upon me by reading Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> upon the commandements and the like treatiſes, whereupon I had a temptation to curſe the day of my birth, which in ſome meaſures I conſented unto, often wiſhing that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born, or at the leaſt had dyed from the breaſt, as I ſaw ſome of my Brothers, eſteeming their condition to be much better than mine, they never living to commit any actual ſin, and therefore (as I then thought) ſhould without all doubt go to Heaven, but for my ſelf I did really think and fear that I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35177:10"/> ſhould certainly go to Hell; then being put out to board for a quarter of a year to one who pretended much skill and ability for the cure of ſome weakneſs that I then lay under, which being a very profane family, although I was yet very young, yet being ſo contrary to thoſe wayes I had been brought up in (to come now to hear continual curſing, and ſwearing, and prophaning the Lords day, and being forced to be in their company not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by reaſon of thoſe fears I then lay under to be alone, and ſo ſometimes prevailed with (once or twice) to play upon the Lords day,) I thought my ſelf all this while to be in the belly of hell, being thereunto condemned by my own conſcience, ſo that I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no contentment in all the fulneſſe of thoſe outward things which I there enjoyed, but was reſtleſs untill I got home again being yet only convinced of my actual evills.</p>
               <p>But when the Lord was pleaſed, by the miniſtery of his word, and other private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions going along with it to convince me in ſome meaſure of my original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I brought into the world with me; then did the Lord inable me, to ſee that all my former deſires would have been nothing, but that I might even then have gone to hell as well as afterward: whereupon I was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35177:11"/> much troubled, and very deſirous to read and hear all the marks of a righteous man that ſhould go to heaven, and accordingly I got a book called Mr. <hi>Roger</hi>'s evidences, and an other called the <hi>Touchſtone of true Grace,</hi> an other called <hi>None but Chriſt,</hi> and divers others; which I did daily read on for many houres together.</p>
               <p>Then came the Divel upon me with this temptation, that I ſhould keep all this my trouble to my ſelf, and not diſcover it to any, although never ſo neer or deer unto me, which temptation I wholly yeilded unto, and that for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until I even deſtroyed my bodily health with continual troubles, fears and ſadneſs, but not diſcovering any cauſe of it; ſo that all the ſupport I had, was what the Lord was pleaſed to hand out to me by hearing and reading, which he was pleaſed to make effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall ſtill to lead me on, though with much trouble and ſadneſs: then in the beginning of theſe troubles being in the year 1638. or 1639. I being ſome 12 or 13 years old, which being times of great fears and ſadneſs, the people of God met often and ſpake one to an other, and kept dayes of humiliation, and ſeeking the Lord in the behalf of the nation and his poor people in it, my parents often
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35177:11"/> going to theſe meetings, but not daring to tell me it, the times being ſo dangerous; at laſt having often obſerved the frame of their ſpirits at ſuch times more eſpecially, I began much to long and deſire to know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they went, and being very importunate with my Mother to that end, and at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, ſhe was content to let me go along with them, which was ſo pleaſing to me that ever after I continued to go with them every week almoſt, and ſometimes oftner; where I found often much refreſhment, eſpecially bearing up my heart under thoſe eminent dangers, which in an eſpecial manner we lay open unto; which the Divel perceiving to be agreat incouragement to me in the way I now deſired to walk in, uſed many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations working together with the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my own heart, in this eſtate of my childhood, to hinder me from enjoying theſe opportunities; as ſome times ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being fain to go early in the morning and cold, it being in the deep of winter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſeveral other temptations, as the danger if we ſhould be taken, as ſome had been, and all this to diſcourage me: which ſometimes he well nigh accompliſhed, but pondering it ſin my minde, and being inabled to conceive it to be but a temptation, I durſt very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35177:12"/> if ever, give way to them but was ſtill inabled to break thorough. Though truely I have much admired ſince, how my ſpirit was carried out in thoſe dayes in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how exceedingly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times my heart was wrought upon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to pour forth teares and groanes, yea my heart was wrought up to ſuch a frame, and I found ſo much ſweetneſs (as I apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) in the company of the ſaints, and thoſe enjoyments my ſoul felt in ſuch duties, that I thought I could freely and cheerfully lay down my life with them, more freely than I fear I could long ſince.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Love</hi> then coming to <hi>London</hi> and ſometimes meeting him at theſe private meetings, and ſo having ſome knowledg of him, and being afterwards choſen Chaplain to my fathers Regiment, and ſo going to <hi>Windſor</hi> with us, about the year 1642. and ſo living in the houſe with us, for 2 years a half, who at our firſt going perceiving much ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to lye upon my ſpirit, and knowing by experience what a troubled ſpirit was; (he having formerly laine under it for divers years,) did at laſt ſeriouſly burthen me with it, which coming upon me in ſuch a nick of time, (having but a little before been reading in a little book that I had, wherein
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35177:12"/> I was directed that if any trouble lay upon my ſpirit I ſhould reveal it that ſo I might receive ſatisfaction; which pondering with in my ſelf) I durſt not deny it but tell him in ſome meaſure the ground of my trouble, and he endeavouring to ſatisfie me from the word; which he had no ſooner done in any meaſure, but ſtill the Divell begins with new and freſh temptations, and when what had been ſaid to me was a little out of my mind (which he would ſoon find occaſion to put out) then comes he over with the old temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations again, working them freſh upon my thoughts, endeavouring ſtill to drive me to deſpaire of ever receiving any mercy of God. Then ſtood I convinced from the word and divers inſtruction I met withall grounded thereupon, that it was my duty to perform private duties as well as publick, as prayer, meditation, examination, and the like, which I knew not how to ſet about in a ſerious manner being every way unfit for it and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it, ſo that often through neglect and miſ-performance this alſo added to my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſadneſs.</p>
               <p>Then hearing Mr. <hi>Love</hi> preach upon that Scripture, Mat. 5. 20. <hi>For I ſay unto you, Except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees you ſhall in no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35177:13"/> wiſe enter into the kingdome of heaven.</hi> And hearing how farre the Phariſees went in the performance of duties and avoiding of evills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I ſaw my ſelf ſo ſhort of, which made me conclude, I ſhould alſo be ſhort of heaven, my eyes &amp; underſtanding being then with-held from the right underſtanding of the ſpiritual ſenſe of that Scripture, (which ſince the Lord of his rich grace hath inabled me to ſee fulfilled in the Lord Jeſus, who is mine through faith.)</p>
               <p>A while after he did alſo preach upon that Scripture, in Heb. 12. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Looking diligently, leſt there be any fornicator, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane perſon, as Eſau, who for one morſel of meat ſold his birth-right. For you know, how that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when he would have inherited the bleſſing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though he ſought it carefully with tears.</hi> Upon the hearing of which it was ſuggeſted to me that I had never ſought the bleſſing ſo diligently, carefully, and importunately as profane <hi>Eſau</hi> did, and therefore ſhould much more go without it; the thoughts of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures among divers others, ſtruck ſo deep in me that it much increaſed my ſadneſs, ſo that I could take little delight in any thing in the world, but as often as I could refuſing to go into any company, chooſing rather a ſolitary
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35177:13"/> life, yet ſtill endeavouring to keep all to my ſelf, making nothing known but only thoſe daily bodily weakneſſes, which did alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me in great meaſure.</p>
               <p>In this condition I continued for that time I was at <hi>Windſor,</hi> being often condemned in my own conſcience, for my neglect of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and commiſſion of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what ever had at any time been ſpoken to me in way of comfort (by Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was acquainted with my fears) it tooke no hold upon me at all, nor abode upon my ſpirit ſave only in the minute it was ſpoken; for, the truth is. I was then too remiſſe in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice or obſerving the paſſages of Gods providence towards me, not being able then to beleeve that it was indeed a work of God upon my ſoul, which ſince, through grace, he hath been pleaſed more evidently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>Then coming from thence to <hi>London</hi> much about the year 1645. being now a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the notional knowledg of many points in religion, I had now a new tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beſetting me in this manner; that if I would but walk more cloſely with the Lord and make more conſcience of all known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whether hearing, prayer, meditation, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That then I might more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35177:14"/> look up unto the Lord, and alſo find in my ſelf divers qualifications, annexed to ſeveral promiſes, which might much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me, which work I began to ſet about, indeavouring to tye my ſelf ſtrictly to it, and according as I was able, deſiring the Lords aſſiſtance, and withall making him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes, that if he would make out love to me I would <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do</hi> thus and thus.</p>
               <p>But upon trial finding my ſelf to fail in every thing, ſometimes through temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to neglect or put off duties for a time, which was occaſion'd many wayes, ſometimes being in company I could not well leave or the like, all which, weighing in my mind, did ſtil augment and increaſe my trouble, finding this ſtrict courſe (though yet I could not keep cloſe to) to be a burthen to me, with many ſuch wicked thoughts, whereby I came to apprehend my ſelf, as it were, ſtill farther and farther from heaven, and happineſs, in all which time I could find little ground of any comfort, unleſs taken from my deſires, which I could not apprehend conſtant neither.</p>
               <p>But indeavouring ſtill to go on in this poor way of performances. I had ſome ſmal comfort, finding (as I thought) ſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in my ſoul which were annexed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers promiſes, where-upon I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35177:14"/> at the preſent ſtayed, and began to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up ſome tottering hopes of the goodneſs of my condition from <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. and ſuch like Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Then living near unto Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> and the Presbyterian government being then about to be ſet up, I had much ſtrife in my ſelf whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to joyn with them in it or no, and ſo to partake of the ordinances whereby I might come to have my intereſt in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſealed up unto me, being exceeding fearfull leſt if I ſhould ſlight or put off ſuch an opportunity, it might be laid to my charge another day, that I had it offered me but would not accept of it, ſo that at laſt I reſolved to joyn with them and partake of the ordinance, that ſo I might come to have my graces ſtrengthened, and my corruptions weakened, and alſo come to enjoy more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Jeſus Chriſt which I had ſome weak diſtracted though no abiding hopes of.</p>
               <p>Thus having been before the elders &amp; there examined ſomewhat touching my knowledg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the time of adminiſtration of the Lords-ſupper drawing nigh; I indeavoured for ſome dayes before, in a ſerious and ſolemn manner to ſet my ſelf in the Lords preſence, beſeeching him to fit me for it, together with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35177:15"/> the examination of my own heart both touching my duties and graces, as alſo touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſins and wants, which I deſired a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of; ſtill begging of the Lord, in all this time of my trouble, that he would not give me over to a deceived heart (what ever he did with me) ſo as to think better of my condition than indeed it was, but that he would pleaſe thoroughly to diſcover my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and heart to me; and thus with ſome ſmal hopes, yet mixed with a great deal of fear, I did that time partake of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the which I had no ſooner almoſt done, but Sathan begins to ſuggeſt to me that I had now eaten and drank my own damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in receiving that whereto I had no right, (through ſo many fears and doubtings in my own ſpirit) and that therefore now in ſtead of receiving ſtrength I ſhould be everyday more and more hardened, and have my damnation ſealed up to me inſtead of my ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But pauſing here a while, and conſidering that I had indeavoured to do my duty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my knowledg and power, in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining my own heart, what my ends, aimes, deſires, and wants were, and according to my ability deſired the Lord to make it a ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and ſealing ordinance to me, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſatisfie my ſelf with theſe and ſuch
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35177:15"/> like thoughts, that my deſire was to ſerve and walk with the Lord, though I could not do it; thus I continued between hope and fear, about a moneth ſpace, intending not to partake of the ordinance the next time, fearing my ſelf not to be fit for it, finding my heart (as I thought) in a very unfitting frame, but, manifeſting this intent to ſome friends, they put me upon theſe thoughts, that the way to be fit for duties or ordinances is not to neglect them; as alſo relling me, that if I were unfit for that ordinance, I was as well unfit to live, and therefore that was no juſt plea: thus being troubled, yet fearing to omit it, I again partook of it, where the Lord was pleaſed, through the miniſtery of his word that day, to hint out to me that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others there were two ſorts of men that might ſafely and comfortably partake of that ordinance, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. All thoſe that had longing deſires after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All doubting, fearing Chriſtians, that come with doubts &amp; fears to it; it being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to be a ſtrengthening, ſealing ordinance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which though it afforded me ſome ſmal refreſhment for the preſent, yet did it not abide, but my trouble ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, yea increaſing, being thereby unfit
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35177:16"/> for any earthly imployment, and yet weary of duties, reading, and writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which I ſpent my chief time.</p>
               <p>Yet thus going on in a road of duties, and performances, ſometimes finding ſome affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and aſſiſtance, and ſometimes not, which when I did find in any meaſure, Oh! how was my wretched heart ready to be puffed up and rejoyce in it, and began to think that now I had done ſomewhat, and that ſurely now the Lord would hear me: but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to conſider more ſeriouſly what I had done indeed, and how many wandering thoughts and diſtractions had paſſed by me, and that any wicked wretch in the world might do, and did do as much as I, and yet the Lord never regarded them, I began to be exceedingly troubled, that ſuch wicked thoughts ſhould ariſe in my heart, imagining that it was juſt with the Lord, for theſe wicked thoughts, to blaſt all my deſires, which I really conceived he did.</p>
               <p>Then conſidering, that the prayers and all the duties of the wicked are abomination, and things that his ſoul abhorred, and lying under the apprehenſion of my ſelf as one caſt off by God whom he never regards, having poured out my ſoul before him and begged a ſoft heart (and a renewed and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35177:16"/> nature,) urging him often with that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a child coming to his father to begg bread, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 9, 10, 11. or rather in my apprehenſion finding my heart grow more hard and my affections more cold and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, I lay under another temptation from Sathan, that ſure I was but an hypocrite in all that I did, and therefore ſhould but heap up wrath againſt my ſelf, (as in <hi>Job</hi> 36. 13.) and this was ſet home upon my ſpirit upon ſeveral grounds, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe as he told me I did not ſo much aim at the glory of God as at that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py eſtate which is to be enjoyed in heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe I could not find my love work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſtrongly towards God as towards my ſelf, deſiring to be freed from the torments of hell which I conceived to be intolerable; as alſo</p>
               <p n="3">3. Finding ſometimes a kind of ſecret deſire that ſome body might hear or know of my performances of duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though I never durſt act in any meaſure ſo, as that it might be diſcerned, but alwayes ſtrove to my utmoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to conceal what ever poſſibly I might, yet finding ſometimes ſome ſuch deſires of vain glory in my ſpirit, that though I did do it thus privately, yet if it could have been known and not by my means, I thought, I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35177:17"/> could be content, and this alſo lay as an heavy weight upon my ſpirit, to think that there ſhould ſuch wicked, vain, and ſinful thoughts and deſires, be ſuggeſted to me, or for anytime, though never ſo ſmal, lodge within me, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. Which when I began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſadly of did but ſtill renew and increaſe my troubles and feares, being a diſcovery of the hypocriſy that was in my heart.</p>
               <p>And for the moſt part of this my trouble I lay under ſuch a ſenſe of the wrath of God, that I thought that all I had, and enjoyed was curſed to me, often admiring that every bit of bread I eat did not choak me, or every creature did not put an end to my life, often fearing that the company I was in ſhould fare the worſe for me, in ſo much that if I went by water or the like, I ſtill conceived I might be an occaſion of drowning all thoſe that were with me.</p>
               <p>Oh! how deſirous was my ſoul, at this time, of the help and counſel of my Godly wiſe friends, and Chriſtians, but through many and ſundry temptations ſtill deprived my ſelf of it, and of the benefit I might have gained by it, through my wicked ſilence in all companies, and loathneſs to impart my condition to any.</p>
               <p>Sometimes my wicked corrupt heart
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35177:17"/> would baſely ſuggeſt to me, that I was not able to diſcourſe or ſpeak of any ſpiritual thing, and therefore I ſhould but only thereby diſcover my own ignorance, and no wayes advantage my ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which when I was inabled ſtill to conſider better of, recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my thoughts, and calling them into queſtion, as it were, then cometh the Divell, and tells me, that this did but note my hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy; and farther, when I have been troubled with it, to think that I ſhould give way to ſuch wicked thoughts as theſe, then comes in Sathan again, on the other ſide, and tells me, that if I ſhould put my ſelf forward in any diſcourſe, I ſhould but thereby cauſe others to have a better opinion of me than indeed I deſerved, and ſo deceive others and delude my own ſoul, and this latter temptation was that which indeed did ofteneſt prevail with me, being ever moſt of all prone to fear the deluſions of my own heart, and ſo eſteeming my condition to be better than it is.</p>
               <p>This going on in this way of wicked, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence made many of my Chriſtian friends (I do really beleeve) not know what to think of me, but were, as it were, eſtranged from me, which I ſoon perceiving, it was a moſt heavy affliction to me, &amp; ſuch as (the ſearcher of hearts knows) lay very ſadly upon my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35177:18"/> which yet I could not, in any meaſure, make known to them, but between God and my own ſoul condoled this my miſerable condition, then being to remove out of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which was an exceeding trouble to me (to conſider how we ſhould by it be deprived of thoſe means which we there might enjoy, although indeed neither my Father, Mother, or my ſelf could enjoy our healths there.)</p>
               <p>And removing into the Country about the year 1647. I found the miniſtery under which I then was exceeding dead and ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, then when I came home (me thought) I knew as much and no more, (to my edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in that condition I was in) than I did when I went; the ſubject which was then, and for a long time together treated on, was that Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>The Lord breathed into man the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul.</hi> The main ſcope of the miniſter being to ſhew, what the natural ſoul was that God had put into man, handling it (as I conceiv'd) more like a Philoſopher than a Goſpel-prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, which notional things were not thoſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> could ſatisfie my ſoul, which wanted now ſome ſupport from heaven, in this ſad droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition I was in, but meeting with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuitable to my preſent eſtate, and being here caſt in a place where I was deprived of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35177:18"/> all other means, I grew ſtill into a more ſad condition every day.</p>
               <p>Then did I lye under a very ſad and ſtrange temptation, to neglect the ordinance of preaching, which was grounded upon the pretence, that I might improve my time at home to my more ſpiritual advantage, which temptation I often yeilded to, and when I had any opportunity, or ſeeming excuſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any ſmal bodily diſtemper, either the head-ach or the like, I ſtill took thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſtay at home, and ſo yeilded to the temptation, and thus I did often.</p>
               <p>But when I came ſtill at night to a review of what I had done, and how I had ſpent my time in each of theſe dayes, as alſo what I had gained, I found it to be ſo little, through one temptation or other, that I now began to conceive and fear that it was only a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Divell to bring me out of love with the ordinances of God, whereupon the Lord alſo inabled me to begin to take a view of my own heart indeavouring to perſwade my ſelf that the fault was only in me, and that ſurely I was ſome way or other pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt the man or his preaching, not looking, (as I ought) to the power of God which was able to bleſs that means to me that he had now caſt me under (contrary to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35177:19"/> my deſires) and that it was therefore juſt with God to let it be to me according to my unbeleef.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I began again to examine my own heart, whether or no I had any kind of prejudice againſt the man, which I could never find nor charge my ſelf withal (having always heard very good words of him from Godly people) only I could not find that the Lord was pleaſed to ſpeak any word ſuitable to my condition by him, but rather to fill me with notions of natural things, and in a natural way, whereupon I turned my examination into prayer, beſeeching the Lord that if there were any prejudice in my heart that lay hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that I could not diſcern, that he would be pleaſed to root it out, and not let it hinder me from the bleſſing of his own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, begging of him alſo that he would pleaſe to put ſome word into his mouth ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the eſtate of my ſoul, and give me an ear to hear and underſtand it, and ſo with ſome hope yet ſtill mixed with fear, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to hear him ſtill, and thus I did often times, ſtill preſſing it upon my ſelf that it was my darkneſs, dulneſs and ignorance that was the hindrance, but finding, after all this, nothing ſuitable to my ſoul to anſwer the longing deſires or ſatisfie the many doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35177:19"/> of it, I at the laſt tould my father how unprofitable his miniſtery was unto me, who alſo concluding &amp; often ſaying the ſame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſeek out where the Lord ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us and be pleaſed to make it more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us.</p>
               <p>So we attended on the miniſtery elſewhere about the beginning of the year 1649. Where I received ſome ſatisfaction, but ſtill (upon examination) finding little profiting in my ſpirit (though I could not but acknowledg that the Lord was pleaſed ſometimes to ſpeak home to my condition) being not able to cloſe in a way of faith with what was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I remained in a very ſad condition, yet continued waiting upon the Lord in that miniſtery above a year, and then returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country, being much ſolicited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, where I found the former Miniſter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a more practical ſubject, I continuing ſtil in trouble of ſpirit, as concluding now the fault to be in my ſelf; becauſe when I enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch means as I could no wayes except againſt, yet I found very little profit or benefit by it, when I came ſeriouſly to examine my ſelf; all which added much to my inward trouble, but in all this ſpace of time (for four or five years laſt paſt) was I exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toſſed to and fro, and continually peſtred
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35177:20"/> with divers and ſundry temptations, both from the Divel and my own wicked heart; to inſtance in ſome;</p>
               <p>I was often tempted to very hiddeous and blaſphemous thoughts, as to think that there was no God, and which temptations were allwayes ſuited to that matter which, at the preſent, my thoughts were working upon, wherein indeed it appeared to be a meer plot of Sathan that ſubtile enemie of my poor ſoul, as for inſtance:</p>
               <p>Sometimes when in the bitterneſs of my trouble and fears I had made any appeal to God concerning the deſires of my ſoul, or had put up any ſhort ejaculation to him, or had been meditating of any of his attributes, or the like, then comes in ſuch a temptation as this, Why who doſt thou pray unto? doſt thou think there is any ſuch thing as a God that thou appealeſt to? did'ſt thou ever find any anſwer from him? with much more in this ſort, and when any Scripture hath been brought to my thoughts, that might afford me any comfort, or that I had been examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my heart from any Scripture, or the like, then (an hundred to one) but I ſhould have one temptation or other darted into my ſoul, to queſtion the truth of it (after this manner) how can it be the word of God more than
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35177:20"/> any other writings? and how ſhall I know them to be ſo? and which of them are ſo, and which not; it being ſo many hundred years a go written, and having gone through ſo many hands, and all writers in ancient times diſagreeing about it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when my thoughts have been ſet or fixed to meditate of that everlaſting conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after this ſinfull life is ended, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to attain ſome aſſurance of an happy eſtate in the life to come, then comes in a temptation, that it is impoſſible that ever there ſhall be any reſurrection of the dead, with many carnal arguments to back it.</p>
               <p>But theſe temptations being ſo hideous &amp; deteſtable even by the light of nature (ſome of them) I durſt not parly long with them, but endeavoured ſtill to deteſt and abhorre them, and to raiſe the beſt arguments againſt them which I could, and in my daily courſe of reading the word, to gather out all thoſe Scriptures that I could obſerve to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of thoſe temptations, and ſo to anſwer them, but ſometimes the more I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned againſt them, and endeavoured to argue it out in my own thoughts, the more they would prevail, which when (after ſome time) I was inabled to perceive, I durſt no longer parly with them, but my only refuge was to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35177:21"/> throw my ſelf before the Lord, and there to tell him what a ſad condition I was in, and how Sathan did continually thus torment me and throw ſuch things continually into my ſoul, which he knew, (who knows all hearts) was the burden of my ſoul, and that which I would gladly be rid off, deſiring him that I might be acquainted why it was thus with me, that he did looſe Sathan upon me, as alſo that he would pleaſe to give me more power to reſiſt theſe his fiery darts; divers other temptations was I alſo troubled withal, as</p>
               <p>I was then tempted to beleeve that it muſt needs be impoſſible for any one in this life, to be aſſured of their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But when I began to conſider, how many of Gods people, who I could not but beleeve by their walkings, did enjoy much of this aſſurance and communion with God, then did this temptation in ſome meaſure, vaniſh; and another ariſe in the roome of it, that ſure, it was impoſſible that ever I ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to any ſuch aſſurance, and that therefore I was none of his children;</p>
               <p>Which when I had ſought the Lord about, and alſo indeavored to attain unto by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, and comparing my heart with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then would this temptation alſo ariſe upon the neck of the other;</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:35177:21"/>
               <p>That I ought not to ſeek or labour too much to attain aſſurance, for ſurely the Lord did not ſee it good for me, for ſhould the Lord give it me I ſhould undoubtedly be ſo lifted up, and ſo filled with pride of ſpirit that I ſhould not be able to contain my ſelf, but ſhould much diſhonour the Lord by it.</p>
               <p>Theſe, with many ſuch like temptations, was I toſſed up &amp; down withal, untill my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was even overwhelmed within me, having no other refuge but only to tell the Lord, and bemone my condition to him who, as yet, ſeemed only to turne the deaf ear to me and to cover all my prayers with a cloud.</p>
               <p>Yet, in all this time of my trouble and temptation, was the Lord pleaſed in a ſecret manner to ſupport my ſpirit, and keep it from utter deſpair, and giving up ſo as to be wholly of Sathans mind, for though my fears and troubles were great and indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable, yet did the Lord ſo ſecretly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me, that I do not know that ever he ſuffered me peremptorily to conclude, that I ſhould certainly periſh, as Sathan continually ſuggeſted to me, though I ſtill feared it, which fears were ſo great that they came well nigh unto deſpair, which notwithſtanding the Lord inabled me (though in a poor, weak and low
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35177:22"/> meaſure) yet to follow him ſtill, often tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that if I did periſh; my deſire was to periſh coming towards him, following of him, and begging mercy from him.</p>
               <p>Then, (in the year 1650. <hi>June</hi> the 28) was the Lord pleaſed to lay a very ſad and heavy affliction upon me, in taking from me my dear and precious Father, who was the chief comfort of my natural life, and this the Lord was pleaſed to do it in ſo ſad and ſo ſuddain a manner, which made it take the deeper impreſſion upon my ſpirit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed adde much to my inward as well as my outward trouble, being alſo accompanied with many ſad temptations and ſuggeſtions; to inſtance in one to two;</p>
               <p>It was ſtrongly ſuggeſted to me, that the Lord had done this meerly in juſt judgement to manifeſt his diſpleaſure againſt me, and ſhew me that he was ſo farre from hearing my prayers (wherein I did often much beg his life of the Lord) that now he would not only take him from me, but even in this ſad ſevere manner, not once permitting him to ſpeake to me, or me with him, which was alſo further aggravated with theſe thoughts, that it was the more juſt with the Lord, thus to deal with me becauſe I had not given him due praiſe for ſuch a mercy as I had in ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35177:22"/> long enjoying him, nor yet had made that uſe of his fatherly counſel and advice, in this time of my doubts and feares, as I might have done.</p>
               <p>Thus being toſſed to and fro, and as it were in a wilderneſs in my own thoughts, to think what the Lord meant by this ſad diſpenſation or would have me take notice of, at the laſt deſiring to ſatisfie my ſelf that it was an affliction of which all are partakers, and that to be without afflictions is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Sonſhip, and alſo conſidering, that it was no other for the matter than what I had for many years both expected and feared, and indeed a wonder (all things being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed) that I ſhould enjoy him ſo long as through mercy I did.</p>
               <p>Thus after ſome time of ſtubborn rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt God, in not ſubmitting quietly to his will, the Lord was pleaſed to enable me at the laſt to begin to bethink my ſelf, what that evill might be in me which the Lord had now ſtruck at, and would me have ſenſible of by this his dealing with me.</p>
               <p>And, upon examination, finding nothing wherein I could more charge my ſelf than in immoderate affection to him, and ſo putting him in ſtead of God, I did at laſt (though with much repulſe in my wicked ſpirit) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35177:23"/> it before the Lord, and begg of him that he would ſhew me, more and more, what his mind and meaning was in this ſo heavy a ſtroke, and that as he had now by his own immediate hand, brought me within the letter of the promiſe (being now fatherleſs) that he would alſo make it good to me in revealing himſelf to be a father to me in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And thus I continued, ſometime toſſed to and fro with divers and ſundry tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, having none to ſpeak a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to me in this my diſtreſs (I making none acquainted with this my condition but in this thing wholly yeilded to Sathan to keep all to my ſelf,) having no eaſe nor vent for my ſpirit but only when I was in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure enabled to pour out my ſoul before the Lord, in which my ſpirit was alſo oftentimes much bound up, though ſometimes again inlarged.</p>
               <p>Then, about 2 or 3 moneths after, being towards the end of <hi>September</hi> 1650. was the Lord pleaſed to caſt my Mother, as alſo my ſelf, both at one time, upon our bed of ſickneſs, viſiting us with very ſtrong fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which being towards Winter brought us very low, which meeting with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble of my ſpirit lay very ſadly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:35177:23"/>
               <p>At which time, in the midſt of all my weakneſs, I was brought to this reſolution in my own thoughts, being toſſed up and down in my ſpirit as well as in my body, ſo that now I did no longer deſire any continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this natural life of mine, nor yet promiſe the Lord any amendment of life, as I had formerly done in all my other ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, though I could never make good any of theſe promiſes, vowes, or covenants, by me ſo made; hereupon, I conſidered (though with much trouble of ſpirit) that I had found by ſad and often experience, that if I ſhould live never ſo long, I ſhould live never the better, nor gain any more aſſurance of my ſalvation and well-being, therefore the deſire of life was now wholly taken from me, the Lord enabling me at the laſt to take up ſuch thoughts as theſe, that from the bottom of my heart I did and had for a long time deſired to fear and ſerve the Lord, and that thoſe many failings which accompanied all my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience were the burthen of my life, and that if the Lord would have been pleaſed to have given me more freedome of ſpirit, and ſet my ſoul more at liberty to have walked after his will, it would have been as a heaven upon earth to me; but contrarily, I ſaw, I was ſtill preſſed under with a body of death,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35177:24"/> by reaſon of which I did nothing but offend night and day, and that the longer I lived I did but aggravate my ſin and condemnation, I did therefore deſire power to caſt my ſelf and the whole weight of my ſalvation upon Jeſus Chriſt, and although I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently beleeve, that the Lord would be good to me, yet I ſaw that there was no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation any where elſe, and therefore did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to relye wholly upon him, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I deſerved nothing but hell, and that, if ever he beſtowed any thing elſe upon me, it was infinite unſpeakable mercy.</p>
               <p>Thus I continued for many dayes often longing for the time of my diſſolution (wherein I ſhould ſin and diſhonour God no more) vvhich both my ſelf and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me thought not to be farre off yet vvas the Lord pleaſed, after ſome fevv vveaks, in ſome meaſure to raiſe up my vveak body vvhich vvas nigh unto the duſt, and after ſome time to go on by degrees perfecting of my health, all vvhich time being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied vvith many a ſad thought, my trouble ſtill increaſing as faſt as my bodily health, at the laſt the Lord vvas pleaſed to turn my thoughts upon thoſe expreſſions of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 5, 11. Wherein he calls his ſoul to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, ſaying, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35177:24"/> ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? hope thou in God.</hi> The Lord ſetting this home with much power upon my ſpirit at this time, (having been all the vvinter deprived of the enjoying of any publick means) the Lord (I ſay) ſetting this Scripture ſo home upon my ſpirit, I began at laſt to reaſon thus vvith my ſelf, and to demand of my ſoul the reaſon of this my trouble; the Lord being pleaſed alſo to put me upon the veiw of ſome Sermons of Mr. <hi>Marſhalls</hi> and others vvhich I had formerly heard, ſome expreſſions in them being brought to my mind, vvherein I found ſeveral anſwers to many things, vvhich I alleaged as the ground of my trouble, I vvas alſo by the Lord I hope put upon a review of that little book called the <hi>Marrow of modern Divinity</hi> (vvhich I had formerly read vvith much trembling) vvith a ſecret perſwaſion in my heart that thoſe vvere real truths, though formerly I neither could nor durſt fully cloſe vvith them, vvhich two means did through the bleſſing of God at the preſent ſomewhat ſettle and quiet my turmoiled ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Then in the beginning of the year 1651. going into the Country and ſtaying about a moneth vvithin 4 or 5 miles vvhere Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> exerciſeth, having heard of him, I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35177:25"/> had a great deſire to hear him, which alſo I did 3 or 4 times, with much content; he being one of thoſe times upon Gal. 3. 8. <hi>The Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the heathen through faith, &amp;c.</hi> Where he ſhewed us fully that God did not juſtifie the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but even heathens, ungodly men, which word added ſomewhat to my comfort, only I could not ſay I had faith, and this ſtumbled me again.</p>
               <p>Then coming to <hi>Colecheſter</hi> and reſting only one Lords day there I heard Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> who, by the providence of God, was then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Scripture in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. Where the Lord promiſeth <hi>to ſend the ſpirit &amp; that it ſhould convince the world of ſinne, and of righteouſneſs,</hi> where he fully ſhewed, that it was the office of the ſpirit to convince humble ſinners of an all-ſufficient righteouſneſs in Jeſus Chriſt, thereupon ſtil labouring to take men off from all dependence upon their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or any thing in them or done by them, which I now found I had been very guilty of, telling us alſo that all thoſe duties, graces or qualifications, that we ſo reſted upon, were not the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore too ſcant and narrow to cover any ſoul, at which time I muſt needs ſay (I do really beleeve) that the Lord was pleaſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35177:25"/> to ſtrike the firſt and great blow to depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on my own actings; although I had yet much confuſion and trouble in my ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this thing, being yet very dark in the underſtanding of it.</p>
               <p>But in this ſhort time of my being in the Country, the Lord having (in ſome meaſure) thus begun, as it were, to ſpeak a word of comfort to my poor ſoul, I was ſtrangly in my own thoughts, (I hope by the ſpirit of the Lord) put upon the deſires of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the people of God according to the Goſpel, and ſo upon the ſearch of the Scripture according to my poor meaſure, to that end, accompanied with the experience I formerly had of that way called the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, which I was now very much unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in, which diſſatisfaction was at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent only grounded upon the practice of them who walk in that way (finding them generally ſo full of wrath, bitterneſs, clamors and evill ſpeaking even of Brethren, which I conceived not to be a Goſpel-frame of ſpirit,) compared with thoſe who practiſe the contrary which was much ſet upon my ſpirit to be more ſweet, humble and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an like, as alſo a way for more growth and eſtabliſhment, being more full of love, (which the Goſpel is ſo full of) and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35177:26"/> over one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which I now ſaw I ſtood in great need of and therefore much deſired, finding my ſpirit then much drawn out to ſeek the Lords direction in it, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him more and more to clear up to me in what way of worſhip I might moſt honour him and meet with and enjoy moſt of him, as alſo when and where I might ſo joyn, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him alſo with much and earneſt deſire to fit me for it.</p>
               <p>Then coming home again my trouble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, to think how my lot was caſt in ſuch a place where I had little ſociety that I could reap any benefit from, and under his miniſtery which I continually found very unprofitable to me, at laſt, making this known to a friend how diſſatisfied I was to hear him, ſhe adviſed me to go hear Mr. <hi>Knight,</hi> which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I did, about <hi>Midſummer</hi> 1651. who (through the aſſiſtance of God) did fully lay open the free and abundant grace of God to poor creatures, who ſee their loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done condition out of Chriſt: through whoſe miniſtery the Lord was pleaſed to go on to convince me yet farther and more fully of my great unbeleef and deafneſs to Jeſus Chriſt, which had wrought ſo many ſad troubles upon my ſpirit, being convinced of which I would gladly have cloſed with Jeſus
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35177:26"/> Chriſt, and relyed upon him, having nothing to ſay againſt it but only my own wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which being ſo often and fully by him anſwered I had at laſt nothing to ſay, but only that I was ſo over-power'd with unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, that though I would have cloſed with Jeſus Chriſt, gladly and with all my ſoul, yet I neither durſt nor could do it (as I then thought.)</p>
               <p>Then having heard of the meeting at Mr. <hi>Knights</hi> houſe, we went thither towards the end of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1651. being about a week before the fight at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> at which time they applyed themſelves much to ſpeak to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition of the Nation and the godly in it, but after ſome time frequenting this meeting and finding much refreſhment and ſatisfaction from it, (about a moneth or two at the moſt after) the Lord was pleaſed to draw out my ſpirit exceedingly to ſpread my condition before the Lord, and alſo crave the prayers of his people in that meeting in the behalf of my troubled ſoul, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, (though with much repulſe in my ſelf) I wrote a paper, wherein I did acknowledg before the Lord that having been convinced of my wretched condition I did thereupon labour and ſtrive to walk more cloſe with the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which being no wayes able
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35177:27"/> to accompliſh, I durſt not believe or go to God as a father, but being in ſome meaſure convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that I was all this while out of the way, (not being yet thoroughly convinced of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, but going about too much to eſtabliſh my own righteouſneſs,) I did then deſire their prayers, that the Lord would be pleaſed to reveal more of his mind and will in Jeſus Chriſt to my ſoul, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to deny my ſelf and rely wholly upon him, and having a fit opportunity of privacy, coming there before any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I laid it down upon the table, and it pleaſed the Lord ſo to order it, Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> being abſent, Mr. <hi>Barker</hi> came in that day, who was altogether unknown to me, who taking a view of this paper among others did mention it before the Lord, both in the entrance as alſo in the cloſe of that dayes ſervice, the Lord putting into his heart and mouth a very ſeaſonable word to my poor ſoul, which was then ſpoken from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. <hi>If ſo be that you have taſted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as living ſtone, diſſallowed indeed of men but choſen of God and precious,</hi> &amp;c. From which Scripture and what the Lord was pleaſed by him at that time to communicate from it, did my ſoul receive very much refreſhment and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:35177:27"/>
               <p>Then did the Lord alſo direct the ſpirits of thoſe that carried on that meeting to treat much about temptations, from which there was many ſeaſonable uſeful truths ſet home upon my heart, finding by this diſcourſe that Scripture in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. plainly made good to my poor ſoul <hi>that no temptation had taken me but ſuch as I now ſaw was common to others,</hi> that I durſt not think but to be the people of God, now hearing them complain of the ſame things which together with the refreſhments and ſupporting conſiderations under each of theſe, which were held out to us, was my poor drooping ſpirit mightily ſupported.</p>
               <p>After this it pleaſed the Lord alſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in this meeting to treat about that great grace of faith, and ſo afterwards to anſwer many doubts and fears that lay upon many ſouls, from all vvhich (being too large here to relate) my ſoul received very much refreſhing, being in the cloſe of that ſervice put again upon it, by the ſpirit of the Lord through theſe his ſervants, to put the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to my ſoul at every turn, doubt, vvhence comeſt thou, or vvherefore doſt thou doubt, and, truely, the Lord having ſpoken ſo much to my ſoul by all theſe means and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments formerly mentioned, that the ſtrength of my doubts and feares began ſo to ſcatter,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35177:28"/> that I could give very little account of the cauſe or ground of them, being alſo now convinced in ſome meaſure that I did by theſe doubts, feares, jealouſies, and hard thoughts of God, much provoke and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, ſo that though formerly I thought it as it vvere a virtue in me to be doubting and queſtioning my eſtate, I came now, in ſome meaſure, through grace, to ſee that it vvas a heynous ſin, and therefore to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſtrive and pray, and do all I could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>Yet did often I lye under many ſad appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions ariſing hence, being convinc'd by the word in reading in one of Mr. <hi>Burrows</hi> books, that there is no vvorſhip acceptable to God but that vvhich is tendered up to him as a father and the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, now I not finding my ſelf able at that time to look upon God, or look up to him under this relation of a father, only looking upon him as a gracious, merciful, and yet withall a juſt ſevere God, this vvas a great trouble to my ſpirit, then did the Lord, by the miniſtery of his vvord diſpenſed by Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> at the Chappel at <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> put me upon the ſerious thoughts of that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 1, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19. verſ. Which at that times took much upon my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35177:28"/> heart in this particular, having no power to gainſay the duty required in it, the Lord being pleaſed, by the miniſtery of his vvord diſpenſed by Mr. <hi>Knight,</hi> and ſometimes ſome others, to come in, further carrying on this vvork that he had thus begun in my ſoul, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling me daily more and more to grovv up towards a more full aſſurance and confident rouling upon and giving up my vvhole ſoul to Jeſus Chriſt; giving me bodily to ſee more and more my own emptineſs, &amp; nothingneſs, &amp; the conrinual need I ſtood in of him, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vvhom I now ſaw that I vvas nothing, had nothing, and could have nothing but only ſin, as alſo that fullneſs that is in him, together vvith a readineſs to give forth and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate out of it to poor creatures, vvho ſee the need they have of it, and come to him for it, vvhich I now deſired above all things ſtrength to do, and that I might go vvholy out of my ſelf, and come to him for life; then hearing that Mr. <hi>Knight,</hi> and ſome fevv chriſtians more vvere about gathering into a communion together, I vvas much rejoyced in ſpirit at it ſuppoſing that, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, the Lord might pleaſe to make it a mercy to me, if I could but ſee him clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my way, and opening a door for me to joyn with them, which work ſeeming for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35177:29"/> a time to go on in their deſires and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet there was much fear aroſe in my ſpirit concerning it, how I ſhould be enabled to make out my condition ſo as that I might be approved of, being full of ebbings and flowings, ſometimes hoping a little, and ſometimes again full of fears.</p>
               <p>Thus being at a great ſtand in my ſelf not knowing what to do, but often ſeeking the Lord concerning it, who was pleaſed at laſt to enable me to take up this reſolution, that (through his grace aſſiſting of me) I would put it upon the trial, relying upon him to enable me to make out what himſelf had wrought in my ſoul, though in much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet I hoped in truth, and this I was the more willing unto, that Scripture or rule of the Apoſtle being then much ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Be ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you with meekneſs and fear;</hi> and though I was very ſenſible of my own diſability hereunto, yet rather than to deprive my ſelf of ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit I was enabled in ſome meaſure to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, yet not without many fears and that ſtrong ones too, that I ſhould not be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of; the Lord now enabling me to take up theſe thoughts, that I would, through his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35177:29"/> aſſiſtance, do my duty and offer my ſelf, and if the Lord ſhould ſo order the ſpirits of his people to deny me, I did deſire to ſee his mind, and to expect ſtrength from him to ſubmit to his will, maniteſted through it, acknowledging it no more nor ſo much as I had deſerved, conſidering with all that my deſire was chiefly, and in the firſt place, to approve my ſelf to the Lord, and (if he ſaw it good) to his people alſo, but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe my deſire was, (though I knew not how I ſhould be enabled to do it) yet, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to wait upon the Lord, and follow him ſtill untill he ſhould ſee good to make out a way for me; then was there a day kept to ſeek the Lord on the behalf of Mrs. <hi>Arnal,</hi> which, by providence, I heard of, and had a deſire to be at, which accordingly I did, at which time my ſpirit was much ſtirred up to crave the prayers of the people of God, that the Lord would be pleaſed to pardon all the unbeleeving workings of my corrupt heart, and thoſe hard thoughts I had had of God, and that he would pleaſe to give in ſuch clear viſions of himſelf, as might mightily increaſe my faith, which deſires of mine were ſpread before the Lord that day.</p>
               <p>But having received, at this time ſome
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35177:30"/> little refreſhings from thoſe inſtructions the Lord was pleaſed then to communicate by Mr. <hi>Knight,</hi> from <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5-13. From which Scripture I was alſo convinced that in moſt of the chaſtiſements the Lord had ſeen meet to lay me under, I had either deſpiſed his chaſtiſements, or elſe fainted under them, the Lord (I ſay) having this day broke in thus upon my heart by his ſpirit, through his word, the Divell ſoon begins again with me, taking this opportunity, I having ſet my ſelf and endeavoured to lay my heart to the word, and ſee what comfortable grounds I could take up, that the Lord had indeed afflicted me in mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Divell now begins to indeavour to puffe up my ſpirit with a conceipt, that I was able to ſpeak more in this kind than many others, who were at that time alſo by him preſented; but through mercy, this did not paſſe many days before the Lord ſadly ſhewed me my folly and weakneſs herein, for a little while after there was an other day kept, to which meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I went, and, truely, after I came there, the Lord ſet home theſe wicked thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſeverall other things which wrought ſo upon my ſpirit, that my heart was even overwhelmed within me, in ſo much that I could not keep it to my ſelf,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35177:30"/> but was conſtrained to diſcover it by my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> taking notice of ſpake to me after the exerciſe; at which time I was ſo farre from that ability, that Sathan poſſeſſed me with thoughts of, that I was not able in any meaſure to ſpeak my heart to him, but was, as it were, one whom the Lord had given up to a dumb ſpirit, and thought thoſe three words, which was all that I could then ſpeak were, (through a meer miſtake) ſadly miſ-conſtrued by him, yet had I not power to ſpeak one word to clear my meaning, ſuppoſing it might poſſibly be that the Lord had ſomething to ſpeak to me, even through that miſtake; there was alſo this day a word ſet home very much on my heart, from ſomething Mr. <hi>Milborn</hi> noted to us which alſo added much to my ſadneſs; and it was this, that I had prayed, and prayed again and again, but when I had done I never looked after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of them, having never yet any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made out to me, that I durſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this or that to be a return of my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nay though the Lord had given in a mercy that I had begged of him, I was ſtill, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, tempted to beleeve that it had been ſo, though I had not prayed, and ſo it was not given in as an anſwer to prayer,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35177:31"/> which did much eat out the ſweetneſs of thoſe mercies which I did enjoy; in ſo much, that (me thinks) I do now even ſtand and admire, what it was that did at that time ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my ſpirit, &amp; carry me on in a continued ſeeking of God, being not able, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord an anſwer of prayer at all that I can bring to mind.</p>
               <p>However the Lord had been pleaſed before this time to give me many gracious anſwers to my poor deſires, yet were mine eyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from ſeeing them to be ſo, and taking the comfort thereof, untill a long after, yea ſometimes ſome years after ſome of them were given in, which yet afterwards the Lord was pleaſed to make out unto me, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the writing hereof.</p>
               <p>But after all this the Lord, by the acts of his providence, ſeemed much to croſſe theſe hopes and deſires of his people, in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in fellowſhip together, which when I heard of, it was a great trouble to me, who greatly deſired the accompliſhment of it, ſometimes thinking that it might be even for my ſake alone that the Lord had done it.</p>
               <p>Other times being tempted to think, that if it had been the Lords acting to work up my ſpirit to that pitch that I thought I found it wrought up unto, then he would alſo have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35177:31"/> gone on to have perfected my deſires, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again inabled on the other ſide to reaſon thus with my ſelf, that it is my duty to wait patiently upon the Lord and ſubmit to him, as well for the time as for the matter, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured (the Lord aſſiſting me) to quiet my ſpirit with ſuch thoughts as theſe, that the Lord might delay it in much mercy, that ſo I might be the more fit for it, when he ſhall pleaſe to accompliſh it, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſurely he ſaw me not yet fit for ſuch a mercy, then did I again turn to the Lord, and thus deſire to ſubmit to him, begging of him to fit me for ſuch a mercy, and if he ſaw it good to afford me the mercy here, if not, that he would direct me where to joyn that might be more for his glory and my ſoules good.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Lord pleaſed to go on well nigh a quarter of a year, ſtill coming in with more light and diſcoveries of his love to my ſoul, and clearing up to me more and more that work which he had begun through his rich and free grace in my Lord Jeſus, in whom I did now deſire only and alone to be found, and not in any of my own righteouſneſſes, who had now inabled me to ſee, to be very lothſome, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though formerly I had too much doted upon them.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:35177:32"/>
               <p>Then in the third moneth in the year 1652. Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> being gone into the North, the Lord was pleaſed by a meer providence (as I deſire to look upon it, not knowing, as yet, but that I may alſo ſay as a return of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my former poor deſires) to ſend Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> to the meeting at Mr. <hi>Knights</hi> houſe, having preached one Lords day before at the Chappel at <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> which occaſioned very ſtrong and earneſt deſires in me to hear him again, which now I did the Lord direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him this time to ſpeak unto us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church diſcipline, which I was yet very dark in, which the Lord inabled him to give me very much and great ſatisfaction, which otherwiſe I have cauſe to fear I might more inconſiderately have ruſhed upon.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Lord pleaſed (I hope in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my poor deſires) yet farther to clear up this way of his to me, proving it clearly to be the way of the Goſpel and that which every one ought to be fully ſatisfied in before they enter upon.</p>
               <p>This being now more cleared unto me, my deſires and longings after the enjoyment of God in this Sion, grew more ſtrong and earneſt, I continually mentioning it before the Lord.</p>
               <p>After this really I cannot tell but that I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35177:32"/> ſhould rob the Lord of his glory in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, if I ſhould not alſo acknowledg him further by my poor experience to be a God hearing prayer, for I found him now alſo (as I hope I may to his glory ſpeak) coming in very much as it were fitting me for this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by giving in (out of his own free grace to his poor unworthy creature) yet, a more full and clear ſight of his work upon my ſoul; and ſo of my intereſt in him, by means whereof I might now the more comfortably offer up my ſelf into the communion of his people, without a ſight of which, I ſhould hardly, I think, have preſumed to have done, which work of his the Lord was pleaſed to help on by ſeveral of his Servants in Mr. <hi>Knights</hi> abſence, as Mr. <hi>Sidrach Simpſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> whom he was pleaſed to make inſtrumental for my ſouls advantage and comfort at this time, which the Lord thus carried on untill it was towards the end of the ſeventh moneth commonly called <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> in this year 1652. at which time Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> being returned home and removing to <hi>Fulham,</hi> where the Lord opened a door for his people to joyn in communion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the Goſpel, the Lord now offering me this opportunity which I had ſo much longed for, and his ſervant Mr. <hi>Knight</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:35177:33"/> to whom I had formerly by an other friend intimated my deſires, he I ſay acquainted me with it I durſt not raſhly deny to joyn with them, but what fears and tremblings there were upon my ſpirit at this time is known only to the Lord, for indeed I am not able to expreſs it, in which trouble my refuge as formerly was only to go to the Lord, beſeeching and earneſtly importuning him now to appear and give in direction to his poor creature, who was now in ſuch a ſtraight as that ſhe knew not what to do.</p>
               <p>But (ſo farre as I know my own heart) leaning alone upon the Lord and waiting for his direction, I went to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet in, not knowing what I ſhould do in it, taking little or no reſt all the night before, but coming there next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being ſtill much oppreſſed in ſpirit; in the turning of an eye as it were, I can not expreſs how or which way my ſpirit was on a ſuddain wrought over to give my conſent, and ſo to joyn with them.</p>
               <p>They being (as they conceived) well ſatisfied in the long knowledg they had had of each other, and their frequent converſes together, ſome whereof were in order to this very work, which having been much deſired by thoſe few perſons that then joyned
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35177:33"/> and they ſo long interrupted, and having put up many petitions to the throne of grace concerning it; Mr. <hi>Barker</hi> being then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and carrying the intended work by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and counſel, we joyned together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel. But this work was not performed in ſo ſolemn a manner as I (for my part) could have deſired, both in ſetting more time a part to ſeek the Lord together in it, and to have indeavoured to have given more full ſatisfaction to each other, of the work of God in each others hearts, which lay as a burthen upon my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which I often bewailed before the Lord, and alſo moved it to ſome of our friends that we might yet meet and ſet a part a day to this end, which was not thought meet at that time; upon which I beſought the Lord it might be no hindrance to his appearance amongſt us, for my ſpirit was oppreſt with fears of Gods not appearing in the midſt of us, which fears were at the preſent heightned from the mighty rage of Sathan, in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of many, yea of ſome good men at this our firſt entrance into communion, laying many harſh cenſures upon us, which ſtill put me upon a more narrow ſearch into my own heart.</p>
               <p>Thus ſeeing the rage of ſome againſt us to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35177:34"/> be very great, and trembling in my ſelf to think leſt we by our miſcarriage might give them ſome ground to ſpeak evill of us, it wrought a great ſadneſs upon my ſpirit, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt we might be an occaſion of darkning his glory to the World, which cauſed me often to pour out my ſoul to the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him that if he had any delight in us, he would be pleaſed to afford us his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>But in the very depth of theſe fears did the Lord, by a meer providence, as I was opening Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi>'s book, caſt my eye unexpectedly upon the 13 p. of the right manner of drawing nigh to God in worſhip, where I found this note, that the beginnings of things of high concernment do meet ſometimes with great difficulties and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; which he gives ſome inſtances of, and ſo adviſeth us not to be offended though we ſhould have ſome ſad accidents to fall out, at the beginning of great things; for (ſaith he) notwithſtanding this God may yet proſper it afterwards; the ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof did at the preſent a little refreſh my ſpirit, and ſupport it with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to wait to ſee what the Lord would pleaſe to bring out of it.</p>
               <p>Thus having, for about 3 moneths ſpace,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35177:34"/> enjoyed the ordinances and the ſociety of his ſervants, and thereupon beginning to examine my own heart, what fruit or benefit I had found by them, it lay ſomewhat ſadly upon my ſpirit, for being able to diſcern very little, then was the Lord pleaſed by a letter from Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> to hand out ſomething which for the preſent did a little ſupport and cheer my ſpirit, therein putting me upon the conſideration of this truth, that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an growth is not at all times ſenſible, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Lord ſee it meet they ſhould alwayes grow in one kind, but that they grow in all parts as well in humility and ſelf abaſement, and in the ſight of our own weakneſs, barrenneſs, and unprofitableneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is as true a growth as that of faith though not alwayes ſo viſible.</p>
               <p>Yet ſome trouble ſtill lying upon my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wanting a full and clear ſight of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, which as yet I had only ſome good hopes of, but no ſuch ſettled aſſurance, but that I was often tottering backward and forward, the Lord having formally and continually, through the miniſtery of his word diſpenſed often by Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> and very powerfully to that end, and ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by Mr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> by both which the Lord was pleaſed ſtrongly to convince me of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35177:35"/> diſhonour that I had brought him by my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef, which was now the great burthen of my ſoul, but finding much weakneſs of faith in me, and an inability to roul ſo fully upon God and give glory to him by beleeving and taking him upon his word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> often fearing that ſinne and Sathan would yet prevail over me.</p>
               <p>But the Lord was pleaſed, about the 10 moneth 1652. to draw out my heart exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to beg of him a large meaſure of faith, even that I might be enabled to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, as much by beleeving as ever I had diſhonoured him through unbeleef, but this ſame month I had this wicked thought or temptation thrown with mighty force into my ſpirit (to beat me off from that pitch of faith which I then found my ſpirit breathing after) <hi>viz.</hi> that where the Lord gives ſuch great ſtrength of faith, or any other grace, he gives alſo as great trials, and that therefore if I had the one I muſt expect the other alſo, and ſo ſhould not only be a means to pull down ſorrows, afflictions and trialls upon my own head, but alſo in lying under them, and ſo ſadly diſhonour God, as now I do, which at the preſent did ſomewhat take of the edge of my affections, and weaken my former deſires, untill the Lord was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35177:35"/> pleaſed to diſcover to me, that it was a meer temptation (whether from Sathan or my own heart, my deceitful, but ſubtle enemies) to skare me with ſuch fears; which tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Lord was pleaſed to enable me to overcome, (with grief that I ſhould in the leaſt parly with it) and again to renew my former deſires, and withal to beg his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual preſence with me in all whatever tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls and conditions he ſhould bring me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he would keep me from diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him under them, and manifeſt himſelf to me through them, and then to do with me as ſeemeth him good.</p>
               <p>A few dayes after, as I was one Evening writing a letter unto a dear kinſwoman of mine, who at that time lay under ſome ſad diſpenſation from the Lord, whereupon I took occaſion to urge that promiſe upon her in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God,</hi> &amp;c. which, whiles I was indeavouring to preſſe upon her the Lord was pleaſed to cauſe it to fall with mighty power upon my heart, which was ſet home upon my ſpirit not only as that which I ſhould reſt upon and expect the performance of, but as that which I had had much experience, through all the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God with me, to have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35177:36"/> made good, ſo that the experience which the Lord had given me of his dealings with my ſoul for many years (in all the afflictions and exerciſes I had lyen under, whether in body, or mind, in loſs of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or comforts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea the very with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> did reſtifie to the truth of this word, having been all of them by the Lord brought and wrought about for my good, the Lord enabling me to cleave the cloſer to himſelf and take the faſter hold of him, from the conſideration of all which, there fell this farther hint, with ſome weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſpirit, that it ſhould alſo be even ſo with me, in reſpect of thoſe corruptions that I was ſtill peſtred with and groaned under.</p>
               <p>But there being yet (eſpecially at ſome times) many confuſed fears upon my ſpirit which I could give very little reaſon for, upon the ſecond day of the eleventh moneth 1652. being the firſt day of the week, the Lord was pleaſed yet further to appear with a very ſeaſonable word to my ſoul, vvhich did much refreſh it; it vvas thus, Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> being in the afternoone (in his miniſtery at <hi>Fulham</hi>) upon that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35177:36"/> Scripture in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. ſtirring us up to hearken diligently to Jeſus Chriſt, and not to let any of his words at any timeſlip out of our hearts, whence alſo he took occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the people of God upon this accompt, that Chriſt ſhould think their eares worthy of hearing his voice, &amp; that he ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſend his meſſengers, nor make uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, but ſhould often rather as it were chuſe to ſpeak himſel; at which words the Lord was pleaſed to touch my heart, and to make it ſweetly to melt before him, with joy to think that Chriſt ſhould thus ſpeak to my ſoul, as I now ſaw he had done by him 2 years before, vvho vvhen he had viſited me vvith that ſore loſs of my dear parent, and caſt me and my Mother both upon our ſick beds, neither of us being able to ſpeak to each other, yea when no friend or creature, either could, or did indeavour to ſpeak a vvord of comfort to my poor ſoul, which vvas in a moſt ſad condition for vvant of a clear ſight of God under all theſe diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his towards me, vvho having, as it vvere, by his own hand (as I now really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve he did) ſhut up and ſtop'd all other mouths, yet that now the Lord Jeſus ſhould chooſe to ſpeak himſelf, as I found he had done in ſome meaſure, ſupporting my ſpirit,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35177:37"/> vvhich vvas ready to ſinck and give up under the heavy burthen it lay, both of the ſenſe of guilt and wrath, all vvhich being put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Oh! hovv did the ſight of his love both melt and chear my heart?</p>
               <p>Then did the Lord alſo, the next day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond day of the ſame vveek, bring to my mimd and thoughts thoſe vvords that are recorded of <hi>Job,</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 9. 11. vvhich after I had pauſed a little upon, contrary to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or thoughts, I vvent on ſtill reading though but in a briefe quick vvay (being ſtraightned of time for it vvas late in the Evening) but I took a view of the vvhole book of <hi>Job,</hi> untill I came to the end of it, and the thing in general that vvas hinted to me, and fell upon my ſpirit from the whole vvas this, that none of al <hi>Jobs</hi> friends vvho in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to ſpeak to him could neither hint out a vvord of comfort, or of conviction, to him in this ſad eſtate, none of all their vvords taking hold at all upon his ſpirit, untill God himſelf came to ſpeak, and then one word of God doth it, making him cry out <hi>Job</hi> 40. 45. <hi>Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee, I will lay my hand upon my mouth, Once have I ſpoken but I will not anſwer, yea twice but I will proceed no further:</hi>] and again <hi>Job</hi> 42. 5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35177:37"/> mine eye ſeeth thee, therefore I abhorre my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes;</hi>] that was (as I conceive) when God ſpake, which cauſed me ſtrongly to reflect upon mine own heart, thereby calling to mind how many inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, convictions, and comforts have been from time to time for many years paſt by ſeveral friends and ſervants of God held out to me, which never took any hold at all upon my ſpirit, but when God himſelf will take in hand to ſpeak, he can bring things paſt and gone quite back again (as he did the Sun up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ont he Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 11.) and bring them freſh into memory and cauſe the ſoul to ſee his hand and work in all, and ſo to abhorre it ſelf for thoſe abominable unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving thoughts, and jealouſies of God that have been upon its heart, when as the Lord hath (as it were) took all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to beget in the ſoul good and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of him.</p>
               <p>Then hearing this ſame night, that Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> was next morning being the third day of this week to begin his lecture in <hi>Friday ſtreet,</hi> to which I had a great deſire to go, which accordingly I did, though with ſome outward inconveniences and bodily danger, deſiring of the Lord, that as he had begun in ſome good meaſure to ſhine in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35177:38"/> my heart this week, ſo that he would pleaſe to make this bleſſed opportunity let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my ſoul have a ſight of himſelf through that word that ſhould be held out to me.</p>
               <p>Thus waiting and depending upon the Lord for his appearance through this inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, I went to <hi>London,</hi> at which time Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> contrary to the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moſt of his hearers (and as I was told) to his own intentions the week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had his eye and meditation turned and fixed upon that grand promiſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. which I do not know but that I may look upon as a ſpecial providence, in which the Lord might aim, even at the eſtabliſhment of my poor and unſetled ſpirit, which but the week before was exceedingly caſt down, the Lord having (as I conceived) much diſappointed my expectation even of his own appearance.</p>
               <p>In the entrance upon which Scripture and opening of it he ſhewed us, that theſe words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. were ſpoken and denounced as a ſevere threatning to the Divel, and not at all ſpoken either to the man, or to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet did they contein in them a moſt bleſſed promiſe, yea all the promiſes which the Lord left both for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to lay hold upon, from the conſideration of which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35177:38"/> he took occaſion to provoke us to lay hold upon all the hints of God and to let none of them ſlip in any diſpenſation of his to us, yea, to take notice of every word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or comfort that God holds out though in the midſt of ſevere threatning, as this here was, in the further proſecution of which he put us upon ſuch thoughts as theſe, that that ſoul which is indeed made to hunger and thirſt after Jeſus Chriſt would be ready to ſnatch &amp; catch at the leaſt crum of mercy, yea were the ſoul indeed found of Chriſt it would be ready to beleeve upon very ſmal grounds: there was alſo at this time, that Scripture cited by him which we find record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Eſai,</hi> 50. at the beginning, where the Lord (as he ſhewed us) ſeemeth to be very angry with that people who though they had played the harlot, and therefore deſerved juſtly to be put away, yet was the Lord wrath with them, becauſe they ſaid he had put them away when as yet he had not, and therefore demanded of them where their bill of divorce was; which together with ſeveral other precious truths then hinted to us, took very much on my heart and greatly refreſhed it, even upon after reviews alſo, but to all this the Lord was pleaſed to add one bleſſed opportunity more that week,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35177:39"/> wherein he ſpeak abundantly and, I hope, effectually to my heart by that ſervant of his Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> at that lecture at the Chappel at <hi>Fulham,</hi> the very next morning (being the fourth day of the week,) ſending his ſervant as it were on purpoſe to ſpeak to me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and to open, unfold, and expound all thoſe gracious viſits of Chriſt to my poor ſoul, when it ſate even in the valley and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, ſhut up as it were in darkneſs and in an eſtate of nature, ſhewing me how the Lord, even then, came in with light and life to me, as alſo when I was under dark afflictions, and ſad apprehenſions of the wrath of God, from whence I conceived them to proceed, in which eſtate alſo was the Lord pleaſed ſweetly to viſit my ſoul, as alſo when I lay under darkneſs of unbeleeſe being full of doubts, and fears, and jealouſies of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at this ſeaſon and from this Scripture <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 78, 79, was the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to unfold my ſoul that which I never had ſuch a ſight of, how he had indeed viſited my ſoul in all theſe eſtates, as alſo what the iſſues of theſe his viſitations were, how he came in with light and life in all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which the Lord now being pleaſed to open my eyes to ſee, my ſoul was even ſwallowed up in the apprehenſion of it, not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35177:39"/> knowing how to bleſſe and praiſe his name ſufficiently for theſe his appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Thus did the Lord follow on with one mercy and diſcovery upon the neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which all depended upon, and as it were opened one another, for this laſt day did the Lord diſcover in particular to my ſoul what thoſe hints and gracious viſitations on my ſoul, wherein all theſe conditions which the day before he taught me I was to take ſuch ſpecial notice of; in the remaining part part alſo of the week was the Lord pleaſed to go on to ſettle and farther open theſe truths, and give me to ſee his mighty hand and outſtretched arm all along in it.</p>
               <p>The next Lords day, being the ninth of this eleventh moneth 1652. the Lord was pleaſed alſo to come in through that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery he hath placed us under at <hi>Fulham,</hi> with a ſeaſonable word to back all this which was ſpoken by our Paſtor Mr. <hi>Knight,</hi> from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2. that the words of God they are ſtedfaſt words, abiding words, words that ſhall certainly abide and be accompliſhed in their ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Thus in theſe eight days, now laſt paſt, hath the Lord, through and by his word and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, been pleaſed to give into my ſoul a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35177:40"/> of his gracious viſitations of me for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> many years paſt.</p>
               <p>And truly I think, I ſhould much rob the Lord of his Glory, if I ſhould not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg him a God hearing prayer, who was pleaſed, even at this time, in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo eminently to appear, that I was conſtrained in ſpirit to acknowledg it and did, and do deſire that he may have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it.</p>
               <p>The Lord having of late thus begun to manifeſt his loving kindneſs to my ſoul, there was at this time, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11. this truth ſet home mightily upon my heart, that this time of Gods appearance in way of love and mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was the only bleſſed time in the world to that ſoul to whom he thus appears, and a time which ſhould of all times in the world be taken ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and carefully improved, from whence I had further many ſeaſonable inſtructions, as</p>
               <p>That I ſhould walk in the ſight of Gods countenance while I enjoy it, yea</p>
               <p>And work in it whiles I had it, before or leſt darkneſs come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 35, 36. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 4. yea to do good in this time and opportunity, whiles God thus ſhines upon the heart, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. yea and to improve it to this end, to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35177:40"/> lay up in ſtore a good foundation for time to come, even as men do in their tradings in the matters of this world, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17, 18, 19. yea, to redeem this time, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 16. to think nothing too much to buy it out of the hands of huckſters, out of the hands of all other buſineſſes what ever in this world.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt needs ſay, that though our Paſtor ſpake much to this purpoſe, and that ſweetly, a while ſince from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Behold now is the acceptable time, behold now is the day of Salvation;</hi> yet did it not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my heart in that way, as theſe few hints did, for the Lord had not then appeared to my ſoul in thoſe manifeſtations of love, as he did afterward, and how ever theſe Scriptures do chiefly referre as I conceive to the time of the Goſpel, and Gods love to the ſouls of men, in bringing of them home to himſelf, yet that truth which was at this time chiefly ſet upon my heart was from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this preſent hint of time, wherein the Lord through his rich grace in my Lord Jeſus Chriſt had been pleaſed to cauſe his face to ſhine upon my ſoul.</p>
               <p>The very next day, being the 13 of this moneth, in the morning when I was awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as I lay in my bed I had that Scripture
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35177:41"/> in <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 11. brought freſh to my mind, (of that woman whom Sathan had bowed theſe eighteen years, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. whom Chriſt looſed) with a perſwaſion, before ever I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to count it that the time of my Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome under Sathan and ſinne would run pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel with this, as alſo my condition, for ſaith the text, ſhe had a ſpirit of infirmity and was bowed together ſo as ſhe could in no wiſe lift up her ſelf, and truly thus I found it had been with me for many years, I had been bound by Sathan under unbeleefe, and the corruptions of my own heart, and ſo bowed together, as I could in no wiſe lift up my ſelf, ſo as to give glory to God by beleeving, and as for the time when I came to count it, from the firſt time that the Lord was pleaſed to touch my heart with a ſight and ſenſe of my wretched condition, and thereupon to occaſion much trouble of ſpirit, which was as I conceive, about the year 1635. which reckoned untill the end of the year 1652, which was the firſt time that ever the Lord did, upon real ſolid grounds, ſpeak any abiding word of comfort to me, and ſo in any meaſure looſing me from thoſe bands, and I did find it to be juſt 18 years.</p>
               <p>This ſame morning alſo a little while after there fell an other Scripture upon my
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35177:41"/> heart, which I found recorded in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. 1, 2. <hi>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth may I ſrael now ſay, many a time have they afficted me from my youth, yet have they not prevailed againſt me;</hi> and hath it not been thus with my ſoul? many a time hath it been afflicted with temptations, and corruptions, but through mercy they have not yet totally prevailed over me.</p>
               <p>There was alſo two other Scriptures im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after this, ſet upon my heart this morning, as firſt, that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>This poor man cryed and the Lord heard him and ſaved him out of all his troubles:</hi> even ſo this poor ſoul of mine hath cryed unto the Lord in my fears, and he hath (bleſſed be his name) heard me and graciouſly delivered me out of all the fears and troubles that ever yet lay upon me.</p>
               <p>And to back this for the future, there was immediately that Scripture brought to my mind in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>He ſhall deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea in ſeven there ſhall no evill touch thee:</hi> the meditation whereof was exceeding ſweet to my ſoul, but whilſt my ſoul lay under theſe enjoyments from the Lord, (which for a time even ſwallowed up my heart in the admiration of him) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuddenly after, finding my
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35177:42"/> heart exceedingly ſtraightned to bleſſe and praiſe the name of this my God, in ſuch a manner and meaſure as my ſoul deſired, for all theſe wonderfull appearances to me, I had this perſwaſion ſtrongly darted into me, that the Lord had ſome ſharp affliction ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to lay upon me, which I was fully poſſeſſed with expectation of, which cauſed me to pour out my ſoul before the Lord, beſeeching him to fit me for it, and ſanctifie it unto me, what ever it ſhould be, not knowing in what way or manner for to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, apprehending it to be ſome ſorer ſtroke than a little bodily affliction, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I apprehended that the ſadeſt outward affliction that could come to me was the parting with my dear Mother, I did therefore ſtraightway apprehend this would be the trial; at the thoughts of which I was at the preſent ſomewhat ſtartled, but within a few dayes on the 23 of this eleventh moneth was the Lord pleaſed to viſit my poor body with much bodily diſtemper, which ſeazed ſo upon my vitall ſpirits, and ſo over-poured them, which together with other diſtempers lay ſomewhat heavy upon the fleſh, in and under which (if I know my own heart) the greateſt part of my trouble was that I could not find out what the mind of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35177:42"/> Lord was in it, in which inquiry there was ſome things the which were then preſented to me as the ground of it; as for inſtance;</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that was darted into me was, that the Lord did it to put a ſtop to me in this very act of recording the loves of the Lord to my ſoul, who hath carried me as upon Eagles wings, and as it were ſet me aloft, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 4. ſo as no affliction or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation hath been able to do me hurt, but have born, yea forborn me and carried me all the dayes of old, as he did his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> notwithſtanding all my rebellions, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63. 9, 10, 12, 15, 16. and this ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ought I know might come even from Sathan himſelf, though I confeſſe it was preſented upon a very faire account, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating into me that it was out of the pride of my ſpirit, which put me upon this action, which cauſed my ſoul to make its addreſs to the Lord, beſeeching him to ſearch me and try my heart and my reines, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all begging of him, that if there were any ſuch corruption in the bottome which was not yet diſcovered to me, that he would be pleaſed to reveal it, and ſo put a ſtop to me in any actings whatſoever upon any ſuch account.</p>
               <p>And though upon the ſtricteſt ſearch and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35177:43"/> inquiry that I was able to make into my own heart, I could find little ground why I ſhould altogether conclude with Sathan in this, yet the very fear of it did for the ſpace of half a year at leaſt, (if I miſtake not) cauſe this work to ceaſe, untill it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſet with ſome weight upon my ſpirit, as that which might make for the glory of my Lord, and perhaps (though weakly) ſtammer out his praiſe, when I ſhall be gathered into into my duſt, who was ſo unable to ſpeak it out in my life; and this I both did, and do the rather beleeve, to proceed from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, the great enemie of Soules, becauſe I find the Saints through the Scripture ſo ready to declare what great things the Lord had done for their ſoules, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 2. &amp; 66. 16. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 22. there was alſo ſuddenly after this preſented to me, as one thing that the Lord might aim at in this touch of his, even to mind, me that I had not that degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion or fellow feeling, as I ought, of that affliction which in ſome reſpect in the ſame kind (though in a greater degree) lay upon our Siſter <hi>Arnat</hi> by reaſon of a great feaver, and doubtleſs there might be ſomething in this, though I ſhould alſo wrong my ſelf, ſhould I not acknowledge
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35177:43"/> much and continued working in my heart for and towards her, which oft occaſioned me to ſpread her condition before the Lord according to my poor meaſure.</p>
               <p>But upon the 25 of this 11 moneth, in the night, I had little or no reſt, by reaſon of the great diſtemper which lay upon me, and really I do not well know wether the diſtemper of my body or my mind were the greater, but both meeting, it lay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what heavy upon the fleſh, which thought it ſelf ready to give up under it, but (my thoughts being continually working) I found in my ſpirit a great natural reluctancy againſt death, which ſeemed at times, as it were, to approach, often thinking that it was not poſſible in natural reaſon that I could continue untill morning, yet ſaid I nothing, for fear of affrighting my Mother, yet had I alſo between times a great deſire, together with a kind of perſwaſion, that for all this I ſhould be enabled to hear Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> next morning, whoſe turn it was to preach at the Chappel at <hi>Fulham;</hi> thus (I ſay) finding in my ſpirit, ſome kind of reluctancy at death, of which conſidering a little, (it being that corruption which I thought had now been in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure crucified, but) finding it ſtill to work
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35177:44"/> up was no ſmal trouble to me, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many other fears that lay upon my ſpirit, as that I ſhould not be inabled to ſanctifie the name of God or honour him under this affliction, which was indeed the ground of my trouble at the approach of death, and (if I know my heart in any meaſure) that only, which I reſolved in my ſelf to declare to ſome friend I ſhould meet at <hi>Fulham</hi> next day, if the Lord ſhould pleaſe to enable me to go, and ſo beg their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance at the throne of grace; but being enabled to conſider better of it, I was given to ſee that it was nothing but a meer tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to diſtruſt the power and love of God, to think as if he ſhould now bring me into that condition that he would not carry me thorough; whereupon I was enabled to gather up my ſpirits a little and in ſome better meaſure to ſubmit to the hand and will of my Father, which I was now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ſhould certainly end in his glory and my good: and to this end, I was now alſo enabled again to call over that bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>That all things ſhall work, yea work together for good to them that love God,</hi> &amp;c. which promiſe I had often found by experience had been made good to my ſoul, and was therefore much troubled that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35177:44"/> any diſtruſtful thoughts ſhould ariſe in me concerning it, divers other promiſes alſo before mentioned were now brought to my mind, and wrought afreſh upon my heart, which did exceedingly refreſh my ſpirit, ſo that the firſt refreſhment which I found was in my ſpirit, and after that was a little quieted, I had a little ſhort ſlumber, and did the Lord ſo farre mittigate my bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtemper, as that it did not hinder me from that bleſſed opportunity next day though accompanied with much bodily weakneſs.</p>
               <p>But upon the 2 day of the 12 moneth 1652. I found my diſtemper of body much abated, in ſo much as I thought it was now quite gone, but that very night was the Lord pleaſed to return, yea to heighten it, conſtraining me to keep houſe certain days, whereby I perceived that this work upon my ſoul was not yet accompliſhed, nor I fully acquainted with his mind and will in it, which was ſome trouble to me, whereupon I again beſought the Lord to acquaint me with his mind and will in it, and to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it unto me, giving me an heart to ſubmit to whatſoever he had yet further to lay upon me, in which I alſo ſought the prayers of his people upon the 6 of this moneth.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:35177:45"/>
               <p>But upon the ſeventh day of this moneth, Providence offering ſome occaſion whereby I was put upon the thoughts of parting with my Aunt <hi>Dogget,</hi> who was upon remove into the Country, with many thoughts there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, which were now brought to my mind, which occaſioned ſuch a heavyneſs to poſſeſs my ſpirit, upon other accounts alſo which came in to adde to the other; in ſo much that I was even as it were overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, untill I was enabled to vent it before the Lord; at vvhich time he vvas pleaſed to diſcover to me, that this vvas meerly to return as it vvere from the Lord to the creature, for comfort and ſupport, as if he vvere not able abundantly to make up in himſelf the vvant of ſuch a comfort, and relation, if he ſavv meet to deprive me of it; the thoughts of vvhich did much grieve me? then did the Lord alſo ſhevv me hovv I had continually provoked him in this kinde, by leaning upon ſuch poor reeds, and diging to my ſelf ſuch poor pits, ſuch broken Ciſterns, as could indeed hold no vvater, and in the mean time too much neglect him the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living vvaters, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>Yea while I was thus pouring out my ſoul before him, and lamenting my miſerable and wretched folly, he was pleaſed alſo to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35177:45"/> caſt my thoughts upon that part of Scripture, I find recorded in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>How the Lord was angry with Solomon becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> which had <hi>appeared to him twice;</hi> even ſo I ſaw, the Lord had juſt cauſe to be angry with me, that I ſhould thus again return to the creature, and as it were, make a God of it, yea after ſuch eminent appearances of his to my ſoul.</p>
               <p>The ſame day did the Lord bring to my mind that ſevere threatning againſt <hi>Moab,</hi> who had been at eaſe from his youth, and was ſetled on his lees, who had not been emptied from veſſel to veſſel, neither had gone into captivity, and therefore his taſte remained in him, and his ſent was not changed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 11, now finding this given by the Spirit of God, as the reaſon why his ſent remained, even becauſe he had not been emptied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could not but ſtand and wonder, what reaſon could be given of the corruptions in my heart, whom the Lord had not left at eaſe, but had often emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied from veſſel to veſſel, as it were trying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and means with me, and yet that I ſhould ſtill ſavour ſo much of the earth, and of the old man, and ſhould ſtill ſo incline to depend upon an arm of fleſh, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>

               <p>The next morning, as I lay in my bed, I had a ſecret perſwaſion darted into me, that the Lord was even now anſwering a great deſire of my ſoul, that I have often yea a long time deſired, that the Lord would be pleaſed to ſearch and try my reins and my heart, and to reveal it to my ſoul, that I might ſee what was in the bottome of my heart, even as he ſaw it, and that to that end he would pleaſe to turn the very inſide of my heart outward, and anatomize it before my eyes, and ſurely the Lord hath been a long time, yea for many years, emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying me from veſſel to veſſel, and turning me, as it were, upſide down, laying me under variety of conditions, and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſometimes under mercies, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afflictions, ſometimes one affliction, ſometimes an other, ſometimes under ſcoffs, ſcornes, injuries, wrongs from neer rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſometimes ſickneſs, weakneſses, pains, bodily trialls, ſpirituall exerciſes, under the power of corruptions and temptations of all ſorts, and in all conditions, and I hope his end is in and by all to purge away my dregs, yea, I hope he is now in this preſent affliction making a diſcovery
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35177:46"/> of my own heart too, ſhewing me how apt it is to depart from the living God, and to ſeek fullneſs of contentment and ſatisfaction in poor empty things, which the Lord grant I may ſo ſee as never more to purſue after them.</p>
               <p>Then did the Lord (the ſixteenth of this 12. moneth 1652. being the fourth day of the week, and our Paſtors turn to preach) ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably backe this former conviction which lay upon my heart, the Lord being pleaſed that day both through him as alſo by his own ſpirit, to ſpeak many ſeaſonable words to my ſoul, ſhewing me that, indeed, the true reaſon why I had wandered ſo long in a vaſt howling wilderneſs without the clear ſight of his bleſſed face, (which as he now ſhewed me) was becauſe I had not indeed given up my ſelf to the guidance and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt, but would be gadding about to find my own way and paths of my own, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 33, 36. and therefore it was juſt with God to deal with me as he did with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and bring me back again, cauſing me with ſorrow to unravel all that I had done, and acknowledg it to be my folly and madneſs to think to find the path of life and glory by any actings of my own without a clear going out of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35177:47"/> my ſelf, and by faith laying hold upon the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Yea, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, upon every new ſtraight, difficulty, or danger, ſtill fell to murmuring againſt the Lord, and againſt his ſervants, even ſo was it with my wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart, how ready was it upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or diſpenſation of God to me, to repine, murmur, and cry out, why is it thus with me, ſurely if he had any love to me it would not? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea as they did many of them, in their hearts, return back again into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> after God had moſt eminently appeared to them, and gone before them and with them, even thus I ſaw it was with my wretched heart: oh! how ready is it ſtill to return back to the creature for comfort? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, with <hi>Demas</hi> to return again to this preſent world too much (and that after ſuch appearances of God to me) did not the Lord ever and anon put me in mind, and ſtir me, and ſhew me what was in my heart.</p>
               <p>Yea, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their murmuring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content cryed out, would God we had dyed in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> even ſo did my wretched heart; ſeeing the difficulty and danger which I apprehended did attend the way to heaven
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35177:47"/> and therefore fearing I ſhould fall ſhort and be overcome of Sathan one time or other, and ſo brought to hell for my ſins, in a murmuring repining way at the various adminiſtrations of God to me, often wiſh'd would God I had dyed in the womb.</p>
               <p>And as they for this murmuring were cauſed to wander in the wilderneſs untill their carcaſes were waſted away, and never ſuffered to poſſeſſe that good land, or ſee it, many of them; even ſo how juſtly might the Lord have dealt thus with me, and have cauſed me to wander in this vaſt deſolate wilderneſs, in my ſelf, untill not only my body, which in a great meaſure did, but untill my very ſoul ſhould pine away in me; but that ever the Lord ſhould give ſuch an unworthy wretch any ſights of that good land, to ſee thoſe bunches of grapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are there in abundance, and to have any ſmal taſte of them, oh! the riches of that grace how unſearchable and unfadome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is this loving kindneſs and mercy? Theſe and many other ſweet diſcoveties of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of my own heart, was the Lord pleaſed to give forth into my ſoul this day, both by his word and ſpirit, ſhewing me my madneſs and folly in not ſtaying in all my waye, to ſee Chriſt go before me, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35177:48"/> guide and lead me, but running before him upon wayes of my own, which the Lord had juſtly and righteouſly, (yea I hope in the greateſt mercy) blaſted to me, which the Lord grant may never more be ſeen in or found done by me.</p>
               <p>Then upon the third day of the firſt moneth 1653. being a day ſet apart by the Parliament for a publick faſt thoroughout the Common-wealth, Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smalwood</hi> with one more kept the day at <hi>Fulham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Smalwood</hi> began the day, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us that it was propheſied concerning Chriſt, that he ſhould come as a warrier amongſt the Gentiles, and that the chief ſeat of this his ſpiritual warre (to let go that of his providential Kingdome) is in the hearts of his people, there being the ſeat of the greateſt oppoſition againſt him.</p>
               <p>Shewing us that the principal thing that man ſetteth up in his heart againſt Chriſt is his own righteouſneſs, &amp; therefore Chriſt wil come to wage warre in that heart where this is ſeated and ſet up againſt him.</p>
               <p>Which, through grace, gave me a ſight clearly of the true reaſon of all thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions, hurries, frights, and tumults in my heart for many years together, that it was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35177:48"/> becauſe Chriſt was coming there, as a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to pull down thoſe fortifications that I was making to keep him out, to wit, my ſtriving and endeavouring, might and main, to ſet up my own righteouſneſs too much; and bleſſed for ever be that grace that thus many wayes both prevented it, and alſo went on diſcovering the evill of it to me, many ſweet refreſhments alſo were hinted out to my ſoul this day, by the Lord, through this his ſervant, which came in with ſuch mighty power upon my heart, as that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but record them.</p>
               <p>Having now thus ſhewen us where it is that this ſeat of this warre of Chriſt is, he then came afterwards to ſhew what kind of warre he doth thus wage in the hearts of his people, which he opened to be the ſame that he waged in the world in his providential kingdome, that is, both an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and a defenſive warre.</p>
               <p>Firſt, an offenſive warre againſt ſin, guilt, and Sathan, ye againſt all ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the heart, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. yea in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. he is ſaid to condemn ſinne in the fleſh] that is, he hath put it out of his office, he hath taken away the weapons of ſinne, ſinne was our ruler before Chriſt came, but when he comes he puts it out of office, takes away not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35177:49"/> only the power but the guilt, yea, makes a great deal of difference between a neighbour and a maſter; as long as you are here below you wil find ſin a neighbour, it wil be viſiting of you, and coming into your hearts often, yea and it is well if you converſe not too much with it; but if Chriſt rule over you ſinne ſhall not be your maſter any more.</p>
               <p>Yea, he brings down not only the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the heart, but alſo every immagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and high thoughts into the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Chriſt doth not warre like men, they firſt take the out-works, and ſo go neerer &amp; neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but Chriſt begins firſt at the heart, and brings down the pride of that &amp; rebellion of that, and then the out-works theſe high thoughts that ariſe he brings them down alſo.</p>
               <p>Chriſt alſo, ſecondly, wageth a defenſive warre, defending that ſoul againſt ſinne, and and Sathan, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20. It is true, though Sathan be conquered in his dominions, and trodden down, and ſin hath its deadly wound, yet are they ſtill conſpiring againſt us, and our defence is only by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. where we may ſee how God keeps his people from being overcome, Sathan he takes occaſion and advantage from our
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35177:49"/> unholineſs and unrighteouſneſs when you come to appear before the Lord, what eve appears of ſinne in you he will accuſe you for before the Father, and were it not for Jeſus Chriſt his accuſation would ſtand, for it is true; but Chriſt comes and ſaith, <hi>the Lord rebuke thee, O Sathan, is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</hi>] as if he ſhould ſay, theſe are a people redeemed by my blood, and in a day of hardſhip, therefore <hi>take away theſe filthy garments from them</hi>] Chriſt will not onely defend his people, but take away that by which Sathan takes occaſion and advantage to accuſe them. Then he came to ſhew us the nature of this warrier, the Lord Jeſus, which was opened in ſix things which afforded abundant matter of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to my ſoul; if where he comes to rule he rules as a man of ſtrength, there is nothing too hard for him. Micah 7. 18, 19. <hi>He will ſubdue our iniquities, thou wilt caſt all their ſinnes into the depth of the ſea</hi>] great ſinnes, as covetouſneſs, pride, and that curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinne of unbelief, are all ſubdued by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Therefore, if ſinne do at any time bear ſway in thy ſoul, it is becauſe Chriſt for a time ſuſpends, and lets his power lie ſtill, and leaveth you a while to ſee your own weakneſs, but when he comes again and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35177:50"/> ingageth your ſoul to him then is the putting out of his power as a ſtrong man.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, he carrieth himſelf as a man of great authority; he hath not onely power and ſtrength, but a right to govern the hearts of his people. oh how ſweet is this to poor beleevers! Sathan hath power to deſtroy you, but he hath no authority; but Chriſt hath both, and therefore it is you are kept by him: he can ſay to the proud waves, to the pride and rebellion of your hearts, <hi>peace, be ſtill,</hi> ſuch is his authority.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ruleth alſo in wiſdome; poor beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ready to ſay the Lord hath forgotten them but there is no ſearching his under ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 27, 28. he can find a way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you from your pride, and urbelief; that you think not of as he did <hi>Lot</hi> out of Sodom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 5, he is that great Counſelior that conſulteth the ſafety of his people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He rules in Juſtice, he ever wageth warre upon a righteous account, and to righteous ends; when he comes to warre in your ſouls, it is becauſe there are enemies there: he never makes a quarrel, but fights becauſe of a quarrel, he is not like a man to come onely to be maſter, no, Jeſus Chriſt evermore find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth enemies or he would not warre; he finds a poor creature unrighteous &amp; unholy, &amp; he wageth warr to leave them holy &amp; righteous.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:35177:50"/>
               <p n="5">Fifthly, he carrieth himſelf as a man of conſtant reſolution, who if he hath once begun to warre and to ſubdue iniquity in any of your hearts, he will not leave till he makes an end thereof: the guilt of ſinne is that which troubles poor ſouls, now guilt is the obligation of the ſoul unto juſtice, it ſignifies in the Greek to tie &amp; bind; ſo when a man ſinnes he ties and bindes himſelf over to juſtice, then God prepares himſelf for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: now Jeſus Chriſt he comes &amp; unties this, and ſetteth his ſoul at liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, that ſinne ſhall not again prevail; he will defend that ſoul to the end, and make it more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour over all its enemies.</p>
               <p n="6">Sixthly, where Chriſt comes as a warrier to conquer, there he alſo comes as King to reigne, he will rule over them and in them, to give lawes to that ſoul, and to give an heart to obey them: Chriſt hath been (haply) a long time pulling down in your ſouls, well he will come &amp; reign alſo there &amp; deſtroy all the works of the Divel in you, and come and rule you, and give you lawes, and a heart to obey them, and that as your King.</p>
               <p>Oh then ſee here the love of God in giving Chriſt thus to rule over us! conſider this love of his from Tit. 3. 3, 4. <hi>We our ſelves alſo were ſometimes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Untill the love of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35177:51"/> God appeared to a</hi> poor Gentile: ſee what he was, a poor fooliſh man, that cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what command is given; yet theſe Chriſt comes to govern nay he finds them not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilly, but diſobedient, ſturdy, ſtout, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous ones, ſuch as will not obey, but Chriſt appears to make fooliſh diſobedient ones obedient, but that is not all, they are held under deceit, and yet Chriſt of theſe makes faithfull ones, yea, that is not all neither, but they ſerve divers luſts, not one luſt but many, but when Chriſt comes to rule, this ſoul ſhall have all ſubdued to him, oh conſider then how free grace appears in this! to whom then will you give up your ſelves if not to Chriſt? This may alſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the perverſeneſs of thoſe that will not be ruled by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then hath Jeſus Chriſt taken poſſeſſion of any of your hearts? ruled for you in your ſouls? brought down the pride of your heart? laid low the tower of your righteouſneſs? governed you in any meaſure? then give him the glory of it, and beg of him further to do it: you find much amiſſe, he onely can mend all who was given for a ruler and commander, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. 4. Oh! behold him as ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35177:51"/> him above all as the onely governour of your ſouls, look on him with an eye of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, waiting for the accompliſhment of his work in your ſouls, and mourn to think that though he was given to govern you, that you ſhould be governing of your ſelves without him, and ſo grieve him; and if Chriſt be appointed by the Father to govern the Gentiles, then ask your own hearts who governeth you? whoſe laws do you obey? what rule do you walk by? what ends do you aim at?</p>
               <p>And truly upon examination, finding that Chriſt of his own rich grace had been thus at work in my heart, and this whole dicourſe being as it were but a declaration of his dealing with my ſoul, which I could not paſs by without ſetting down, and putting it upon record, it ſeeming to me, even as if the Lord had ſpoken from heaven to my ſoul in particular; therefore I think I ſhould much diſhonour him, if I ſhould not, to his praiſe, in the deſires of my ſoul acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that every one of theſe markes of Chriſt have been in ſome meaſure (ſome more ſome leſs) through grace, wrought by him in my heart, though I muſt ſtill acknowledg that there is too much oppoſition againſt him in my ſoul, which I deſire to wait and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35177:52"/> do expect according as hath been expreſſed, the utter ſubduing thereof, which time (I hope) haſteth when Chriſt will come &amp; take up full poſſeſſion of my ſoul, &amp; rule in it and over it for ever.</p>
               <p>The ſame day, in the cloſe of it, Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> ſpent a little time upon <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 24. from which there was alſo many gracious diſcoveries hinted out to my ſoul, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods readineſs to hear before his people call, where he puts us upon warchfulneſs, what work Chriſt was about in the nation, which the Lord was pleaſed to make as a ſpur to my dul ſpirit to look out what that work was that God was now doing, or about to do in my heart, even I hope fitting of me for a more full enjoyment of himſelf; then did the Lord alſo by his ſervant declare out to us in theſe latter dayes, theſe Goſpel times, wherein God haſtens his work: which throughly I found to be made good to my poor ſoul, the Lord having been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed exceedingly to haſten his work upon my heart, and the manifeſtation of his bleſſed face to my ſoul, even faſter then my ſcant heart could imagine. Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of this in his manner cauſed my ſoul to enter into theſe ſerious thoughts and conſiderations, whether I might not hence
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35177:52"/> argue, that, ſure, the Lord was nigh the accompliſhment of it by putting an end to to the ſinful dayes of my Pilgrimage here below; yea, here did the Lord ſhew me that whatever it be that lies in the way when he comes to do this great work he wil remove, or down with it: and truly, this I ſaw through grace, to be his manner of dealing with my ſoul, be it my own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, be it meer relations on whom I too much leaned, and conceived my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to lie much in, be it what it will, Chriſt will remove it when he comes to do his great work; therefore, as I was then taught, I ought to relie ſtill upon Chriſts rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, which the Lord grant I may. There was alſo hinted to us that nothing was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the Saints call, but Gods anſwer, where the Lord was pleaſed to convince my ſoul of the evil that I had ſo long been guilty of, that I ſtill poured out my prayers before the Lord, but never regarded any anſwer, concluding that God would never anſwer them, and truly now the Lord hath been pleaſed to ſhew me that it is a great ſinne in me to content my ſelf in pouring out my deſires, and never looking after the returns of them, untill the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuddenly, and in an unexpected manner
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35177:53"/> and meaſure, as he hath promiſed to come in with an anſwer to my ſoul, even before I thought of it, or expected it, though I had often begged it of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Another thing was then hinted to my ſoul, which the Lord hath been pleaſed to give me much experience of, to wit, what a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing it is, and comfortable to the ſoul to have mercies come in as an anſwer to prayer, which is that which maketh them ſweet indeed to that ſoul that enjoyeth them; there was alſo at this bleſſed ſeaſon that objection anſwered, that the Saints of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pray and yet God doth not anſwer; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Firſt, that many times they do not well underſtand Gods anſwers, but his anſwers are very full though they underſtand them not: Secondly, yea ſometimes he anſwers by converſing with the ſoul at that time, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into his preſence with that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; Thirdly, by giving of them ſtrength of grace for the attendance and waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; Fourthly, ſometimes by awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſoul by a due prizing of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies begged; Fifthly, ſometimes by giving in of mercies that are not in the ſame kind the ſoul would have them: every of which wayes I now ſee the Lord hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thoſe prayers which formerly I
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35177:53"/> thought had been covered with a cloud; from all wich did the Lord ſtir up my ſoul to a quick, lively, diligent ſearch into the anſwers of prayers that had been put up to the Lord by my poor ſoul for many years paſt to this day, in the ſearch of which I found many rich anſwers that I had long robbed the Lord of the glory of.</p>
               <p>The ninth of <hi>March</hi> did the Lord pleaſe to ſend that ſervant of his Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> to the Chappel at <hi>Fulham,</hi> who did from the Lord declare a moſt gracious and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble word to my ſoul, which the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bleſſe to me, and may be ground for my faith while I have a day to live in this ſinneful world, that which the Lord was pleaſed to hint from him 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 22, 23. from which he took occaſion to ſhew us that Chriſt do ſtand in that relation to all his Saints, as the naturall head doth to the natural body; and that therefore as in the natural body all thoſe perfections that are in the head, are in it, for the good and uſe of the whole body; and that if every limb and joint, if it could ſpeak, it might ſay, I am at eaſe, I can ſee, taſte, ſmel, and the like, therefore all theſe perfections in Chriſt the head are in him for the good and uſe of every one of his members.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:35177:54"/>
               <p>What ever can be ſpoken concerning Chriſt as undertaking the work of mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they are theſe perfections of Chriſt the head; as for example, as the fulneſs of Chriſts perſon, his divine and humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, all the excellencies of his offices, all his merits, and all his ſatisfactions, gifts, graces, every thing that can be truely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Chriſt, ſince he was deſigned of God for the ſalvation of man, all theſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are purpoſely in him for the good of his Church, he proved it from <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. Where he is called <hi>the ſurety of a better Teſtament;</hi> Chriſts love is ſet out by a ſurety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; now a ſurety, as a ſurety, is wholly for the good of them whom he is thus a ſurety for; if a man, as a ſurety, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bound to an other, when he ſeals the bond he doth it as a ſurety; when he is arreſted for the debt, it is as he is a ſurety; when he payes the debt, when he cancels the bond, he doth it as a ſurety, all he doth; from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end, is onely his voluntary act undertaking to be a pawne and pledge; Thus did Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>God the Father he enters into a covenant with loſt man undertaking to be the God of ſinfull man, and man covenants to be his people; he covenanteth to give them this benefit, and they to yeild him this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35177:54"/> now Jeſus Chriſt he comes and undertaketh to be a ſurety for both, he undertaketh to God, on mans part, all that man oweth ſhall be paid, every jot of duty to be performed ſhall be performed; and on Gods part, he undertaketh all the good that God hath promiſed ſhall be made good to them upon their beleeving; thus he is a ſurety.</p>
               <p>The like expreſſions you have <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 21. when Chriſt prayed to the Father for them, whom he undertook, firſt, to bring them home, then, to keep them in this world, then, that they might partake of his glory with the Father; <hi>for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf:</hi> now to be ſanctified ſignifieth ordinarily to be made clean from corruption, and indued with grace and holineſs, but ſanctification in this place properly is nothing elſe but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to God, therefore, ſaid Chriſt, I did ſeparate my ſelf, give up my ſelf to God; and all the work that Chriſt undertook he expreſſeth in that word, <hi>he ſeparated himſelf for</hi> their ſakes: ſo that if you do ask why was the Sonne of God made man? why he lived? why he died? why he preached? why he prayed? all was for their ſakes, that is, for their ſakes whom he there prayed for: and then in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be made unto us wiſdome, righteouſneſs,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35177:55"/> ſanctification and redemption,</hi> Chriſt was made all this, and he was made it of God, and made it for us, wiſdome to us, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us, all to us; nay there is no one thing ſpoken of Chriſt through the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but there are plain Scriptures that do ſhew, that it was for us: when he was made fleſh, the Scripture ſaith, it is to us <hi>a child is born, and a ſonne given;</hi> when he lived, he lived for us, he is ſaid to die for our ſinnes, and riſe again for juſtification; he aſcended for us, and ſitteth at Gods right hand for us, for our ſakes he returns to judgement. Oh how abundantly did the Lord refreſh my poor ſpirit from theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures! thinking with my ſelf, oh wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart, why ſhouldeſt thou ever harbour one hard thought of God or Chriſt more? or give way to one doubt more?</p>
               <p>Then, in the application he came to put this lively queſtion to our hearts.</p>
               <p>Whether do any of you relye on Chriſt for your Saviour, and ſee the need you have of him? hath the Lord convinced you of your own loſt undone condition through ſinne, perſwading you to go to Jeſus Chriſt, and caſt your ſouls on him to undertake for you? doth God witneſs with your ſouls, that really and ſincerely, above all things
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35177:55"/> in the world you deſire to be found in Chriſt? if this be thy condition (to which my ſoul did, and doth anſwer before the Lord, Lord thou ſearcher of hearts knoweſt, by thy rich grace, thou haſt many years ago brought my ſoul to this very frame) then what is it thou canſt want, if Chriſt be thy Saviour? why all that is in him is for thee, all that wiſdome and grace that is in him is for thee, and will not this anſwer all thy objections; if thou couldeſt but underſtand it rightly, what is it thou canſt ſay thou wanteſt but it is in Chriſt? I, ſaith the ſoul, I know he is all-ſufficient; then this is in him for thee.</p>
               <p>Then he came to anſwer a great objection? which (I muſt confeſſe) hath puzled my ſoul many a year, and laid me under very ſad feares, which the Lord cleared up in ſome meaſure to my ſoul heretofore, but much confirmed me at this preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I but (ſaith a ſoul) if I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed partake of this you ſpeak of, oh! this would ſettle my poor heart; but this rather maketh me fear that I have no part in Chriſt, if all that he hath be for his members; if I were one of his members how come I to be ſo emptie? could he then deny me that which I humbly beg of him every day? the Lord is my witneſs (ſaith the ſoul) that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35177:56"/> I have for many years made my daily ſuit, that Jeſus Chriſt would pleaſe to give me pardon, and grace, and wiſdome, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſerve him; if he be a friend, yea, and truſty, and thus faithfull, would he deny it me if I had a right to it? therefore I rather fear, I am none of his.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Say not ſuch a word (ſaith he) for it may be, thou haſt a great deal more then thou doſt take notice of; If Jeſus Chriſt hath tendred ſatisfaction to the fathers juſtice, and the Father hath accepted of it, and if he hath merited all grace for thee, and hath already purchaſed it for thee, and will give it out when thou haſt moſt need, thou art then more happy by having it in his hand, then if it were in thy own keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: even as if one were my ſurety, haply I want much wherewith to pay all my debts, and to provide that for me which I want; now if he goes and cancells all my bonds, and purchaſeth in his hands whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I need, is not this for me, though not yet delivered into my own hand? thou muſt by that eye of faith ſee what Chriſt hath done to the Father, and what in his own hand he hath received from the Father: and if it be in his hand for thee, is it not as good as in thine own?</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:35177:56"/>
               <p n="2">2. Thou ſayeſt thou haſt ſo little, It may be thou mighteſt have a great deal more then thou haſt, if thou wert indeed content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Chriſt ſhould be the well-head, and thou onely the ciſtern; but we would faine have our portion of grace to be in our own hands, and then we would look upon our ſelves to be as ſomebody; whereas, if we could be but contented to let Chriſt have the honour of all, and we think it enough to be but partakers of it by faith, we ſhould have much more commited to our hands then we have already. Oh how fully did theſe two anſwers come in upon my heart!</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are no better arguments of a heart filled with grace, then to be mourning for the want of grace; for look in the book of God, and there they that make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt moane over their own hearts, and their want of grace, they are the moſt eminent of all other, as we ſee in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> this I ſpeak (ſaith he) not to encourage any in a careleſs lazy way, but to comfort drooping ſpirits, and the rather, becauſe there is no way under heaven ſo like to make you really holy as to be emboldened thus to go to Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſoul ſeeing what full and free grace comes from Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35177:57"/> the love of Chriſt would conſtrain the ſoul to walk holily and thankfully towards him; thus knowing there is all fullneſs in Chriſt as in the head for the uſe of all the members, then, accordingly, as ſoon as ever you find any defect in your ſelves in any kind to interrupt your comfort and peace, let the next queſtion be, But hath he not ſufficiency for this? then betake to Jeſus Chriſt: as ſuppoſe a poor woman were going with her pale of water which ſhe had drawn out of a well or living fountaine, and on a ſudden had a ſlip, and ſpilt it all out of her paile, and there ſitteth crying to think what ſhe had loſt, now whether were it better, or a ſign of more wiſdome for her to ſtand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up of that which ſhe ſpilt, or to go and dip her paile into the Well again, and ſo fill it preſently? ſurely the laſt were her wiſdome: ſo when we loſe our peace and our comfort, we ought to be humbled, but to think to recruit our ſelves by our ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up that which we have loſt, this is not our wiſdome; let us go to Chriſt, our well-head, and make it up preſently.</p>
               <p>From which the Lord did indeed convince me much of my folly, having been ſo long at work to ſcrape and gather up ſomewhat of that I had loſt, neglecting Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35177:57"/> where was fullneſs; then did the Lord, by this ſervant of his, mightily provoke us to a diligent ſtudy of Jeſus Chriſt, to bend our mindes, heads, and hearts and all, to come to know what ever there was that was knowable in Jeſus Chriſt, and that from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the excellency of this knowledg above all other knowledg; yea further, what ſoever you learn of Jeſus Chriſt you learn but to underſtand your own wealth, and know your own happineſs; for inſtance, imagine two men coming by ſome delicate houſe full of rich treaſure, and an officer ſhould ſtand by and ſay, Sir are you willing to ſee all the riches of this houſe? haply you will ſay (for curioſity ſake) we care not if we do; but if he comes to one of them and ſayes, Sir, all that is here is yours, you are made whole executor, and it is all bequeathed to you, oh! how would this man ſearch the houſe? how he would ſtudy every deed, and every word in it, and ſearch every cabinet, and get an inventory of all that was there; why, for they are all his: ſo, when we ſee the wealth, rarities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we ſay, but what do they concern me? or if I ſhould ſee the wealth of <hi>Solomon,</hi> what am I the richer? but when I ſee the wealth of Chriſt I ſee my own riches.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:35177:58"/>
               <p>Oh my ſoul, the Lord grant that this may be thy ſtudy day and night! here indeed is the difference you ſhould make between Chriſt and others, when I hear and read the excellencies of other Saints, it may be a diſcouragement, as when I read of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of <hi>Job,</hi> I am diſcouraged, becauſe I am ſo peeviſh; when I read of the holineſs of <hi>David,</hi> who prayed ſeven times a day, and many times in the night riſing to prayer, this diſcourageth me; but when I read of Chriſts patience or bolineſs, I look on him, not as abſtract from me, but as my head, as one that all he did was for me; oh, then who would not but know what is knowable of him!</p>
               <p>But then again, did Chriſt do all he did for us? then ſurely every thing, yea, all that a Chriſtian hath ſhould be for Chriſt, and then ſhould we ſhew our ſelves Chriſtians indeed, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. for (ſaith he) <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtrained us, for we thus judge, that if Chriſt died for us, then were we dead; then we that live ſhould live to him that died for us;</hi> the love of Chriſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, and carried him captive, as a ſtrong ſtream would carry a little cockboat: what was I dead, and did Chriſt give me life? then if by the grace of God I live, I
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35177:58"/> will give that life to Chriſt: never do you live like a Chriſtian till you come to this, to live wholly to Chriſt in all that you have and do enjoy, your eſtate, Trade, and in all your outward comforts; and its moſt certain that to a gracious heart there is no Rhetorick under heaven will more prevail to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a duty, or to the avoiding of what is evil, then to perſwade to the one, or to forbear the other, by the love of Chriſt; this drawes out the heart to be liberal for Chriſt, and ſerviceable to Chriſt; oh how full did theſe convictions come upon my heart! the Lord having but juſt before been pleaſed to give in a portion of the outward riches to me, which wrought ſo upon my heart, and made me greatly to deſire and beg of God, that whatever I had or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might be wholly improved for Jeſus Chriſt and for the advancement of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>The 18 of <hi>March,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome bodily diſtemper, not being fit to preach, my heart was drawen out to go to <hi>London</hi> to hear, though with ſome bodily prejudice, not being very well, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falling out wet, yet did the Lord provide a comfortable and refreſhing word for my poor ſoul, both from Mr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> whom I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35177:59"/> heard in the morning, as alſo from Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> whom I heard in the afternoon, Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> ſpake from that Scripture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6, 7. verſes.</p>
               <p>The 23 of <hi>March,</hi> 1652. being the fourth day of the week, did the Lord go on yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſpeak many comfortable rrefreſhing words to my ſoul, from Mr. <hi>Knights</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, who then ſpake to us from that Scripture in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi> whence was obſerved, That as love beaming out from God to his people takes them up into union with himſelf, ſo this union occaſions the reflection upon that divine love, whereby we love God again; ſo that, being beloved we love the firſt lover which is God. There are two things very pleaſing to gracious hearts, the one is to take a view of God in his rich love; &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to veiw our ſelves intreſted in that love.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, all ſights of God are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe his glory paſſeth through all his diſcoveries; but no ſight more raviſhing then that of his love, and no love like his diſtinguiſhing love, with which he loves his people, whereby he makes them both lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lovely, for the beauty of a Saint is the beam of his love, and the luſtre and glory of that love is, that it ſprings from his love who loved us firſt.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:35177:59"/>
               <p>And here he ſhewed us, that in theſe words we had a loving and beloved diſciple of Chriſt, taking a due ſurvey of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all ſaving operation to be in God himſelf: and ſecondly, that from the light of that divine love he looks into his own and other beleevers hearts, and finds a ſtrange reflection of the divine beam of love from God in his, and their loves to God again.</p>
               <p>In the firſt was ſhewed the glory of the perſon loving which is God: ſecondly, the manner of his communicating of all ſaving good, its through love; and then the object of this love (us;) and laſtly, the priority of it, he loved us firſt; where was further obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that this is a communicative nature in the goodneſs of God, it is not drawn forth, but puts forth it ſelf in love, that there is nothing in the creature to procure it, neither can any thing in the creature hinder it; whiles we were yet enemies he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled us by the blood of his croſs.</p>
               <p>This love in God is a nature not a paſſion.</p>
               <p>And all he hath, and is, and doth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, iſſues through his love, his wiſdome, power, all is communicated through love, ſo that we were taught,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Saints are the bleſſed ones of God.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:35177:60"/>
               <p>Secondly, they are beloved before they love.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that they that are beloved of him do love him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that they love him becauſe they are firſt beloved.</p>
               <p>And by Application of theſe we are taught.</p>
               <p>Firſt to be like our heavenly Father in love, yea in loving where we are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; this was a ſingular thing required of the Saints, eſpecially to love mens ſouls, the ſtream of divine love it runs in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mens ſouls; it loves to be like God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let no man glory in what he is, what haſt thou that is not an iſſue of this love? this love makes the difference between thee and others, be not high minded but fear.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider your ingagements to divine love, you owe all you have, and are, and all you ſhall be to eternity to this love of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we were exhorted to look out for as much as love could yeild us; love in man ſets the whole ſoule a work to ſearch for ſome ſuitable thing that may beſt pleaſe its object: ſo God takes up the beſt wayes to make the glory of his love ſhine moſt clearly towards us, and therefore unvailes it in the face of Jeſus Chriſt: as alſo fifthly, we
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35177:60"/> were exhorted to walk anſwerable to this love.</p>
               <p>Firſt, humbly, it is a free love that is the ſpring of all we have and are.</p>
               <p>Secondly, look into all your wayes, to ſee what fruit this great and glorious ſeed of love brings forth in you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, be transformed into love, that you may be lovely as well as beloved.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as you look into Gods firſt love, ſo look into your own firſt love; abate not of your love to him, for he abates not: what he ever was, that he will be unto you.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if the Saints are beloved, let me take heed of abuſing Gods beloved ones, his darlings.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, walk chearfully, you are beloved from above, what if the ſervant frown ſo the Maſter love?</p>
               <p>Give God your firſt love.</p>
               <p>Give God your ſelf, in your lives, not onely your duties but your ſelves; for God gives you, in his love not onely your pardon, and gifts and graces, but himſelf.</p>
               <p>Be not jealous of God, he loved firſt,</p>
               <p>Be like God, be firſt in love to the Saints, look not for love to your ſelf but be lovely to others.</p>
               <p>Love firſt, and that will draw love.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:35177:61"/>
               <p>God liveth where he loveth, he loveth us firſt, then God liveth where he loveth, as the creature is ſaid to do: if God loveth us, then he is ſaid to live within us, and that continually; and therefore as ſure as God liveth there is a reall heaven in the heart of the Saints, for as God liveth in heaven, ſo he doth in the heart of his Saints: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay not, who ſhall go into heaven to ſee God? but if God loves thee, and his heart be ſet on thee, there is that lovein thee that ſhall ſee Gods love to thee, which is a heaven to the heart.</p>
               <p>Is Gods love to you? then look for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Gods love can afford; now what will not love afford to a mans wife or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? it contenteth them not that they have meat, drink, apparel, but that they have that which is ſuitable to their relations and condition in this world: now all in God iſſues through his love; therefore, oh Saints! raiſe your hearts to look for as much as this love can afford, ſo as your hearts may ſtand and wonder at the height, depth, and length of the love of God.</p>
               <p>Oh how ſhould your hearts rejoyce! ye live not by what you have, but on what is in the heart of your Father; oh! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go with open mouths, and enlarged
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35177:61"/> hearts to him, for if he can find any admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration that may moſt fill and ſatisfie your hearts, look for that, becauſe he thought no blood could ſatisfie you, but his Sonnes blood.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he thought no gift like that of his Sonne, oh therefore let not your hearts be ſtraightned! do not content your ſelves with little things, and ſay, oh! if I can but ſcrabble to heaven I care not; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in what relation you are ſet, even under the beams of divine love, therefore look for as much as this love affordeth you.</p>
               <p>Oh how abundantly did the Lord refreſh my ſpirit from theſe precious truths thus hinted out to me! and ſtill he goes on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming my ſoul in the apprehenſion of his love; which doth (in ſome meaſure) cauſe my ſoul to turn back with love to him again, which the Lord increaſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of <hi>March</hi> 1653. having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Church-meeting, every <hi>Wedneſday</hi> after the lecture at <hi>Fulham,</hi> and it being now to begin, and the brethren being put upon it to exerciſe their gifts, the Lord was pleaſed much to draw out my heart to beg his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and pouring out of a large meaſure of his ſpirit upon the brethren, fitting them
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35177:62"/> for this work, taking ſpeciall notice of one of them, whoſe ſpirit did melt before the Lord into tears in the apprehenſion (as I conceive) of the weight of the work, which (I confeſs) took much upon my heart; and drew it out very much to ſeek the Lord on their behalf, as alſo that it might be a bleſſed opportunity to all our ſouls.</p>
               <p>The 28 of <hi>March,</hi> how many ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments did the Lord hand out to my ſoul? (which I deſire may abide upon my ſpirit) through Mr. <hi>Knights</hi> miniſtery at <hi>Fulham,</hi> from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>Take, eat, this is my body that is broken for you, this do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me;</hi> from the word <hi>[take]</hi> there are ſeven conſiderations, full of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant comforts, as they were ſet upon my heart, as</p>
               <p>Firſt, here obſerve Chriſts heart, and ſee with what bowels of affection he ſpeaketh, how freely himſelf offers the riches of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>[take]</hi> why what, or whom ſhould we take, but himſelf, poſſeſs himſelf? thus he ſtandeth calling and crying, <hi>take me, love me, receive me, eat me, drink me;</hi> let me be yours, oh high love! he doth not bid the ſoul take wrath, vengeance, death, or hell, but take me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his commands are more to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35177:62"/> you then himſelf, why ſhould we take Chriſt? why <hi>this is my body that was broken for you, my blood that was ſhed for you,</hi> take me for your own ſakes, for you need me, to refreſh your hearts, therefore take me not that I ſhall be the better by it, but that you may have more pleaſure and delight in me, that may do you all good: oh high love!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, obſerve, Chriſt ſees our need better then our ſelves, there are bowels of compaſſion in him; what, for a man that enjoyeth much to look out for them that want much? yet ſo it is here, you have not the diſciples crying, oh Chriſt give us thy ſelf, and blood, but here is a Chriſt who having it, and knowing that we ſtand in need of it, offers it freely, [take] oh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable love!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, obſerve, he is not content till you be fully ſupplyed, he ſetteth no bounds, but <hi>take and eat as much as your hearts will hold;</hi> take what? <hi>whole me, all of me;</hi> my ſpirit, blood, mediation with the Father, all my righteouſneſs; take all, he ſtinteth no man, but opens wide the treaſure of his grace.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, obſerve hence, Chriſt is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the fears of his Saints hearts, therefore, ſaith he, <hi>[take]</hi> imploing, as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35177:63"/> if the trembling heart would ſay, O Lord, I dare not, theſe things are too great and good; I know thy fears (ſaith Chriſt) but I lay a law on thee that wil make thee give over all, for this law comes with power; <hi>take and eat,</hi> he bids you take, and that on pain of diſobedience to Chriſt, when Sathan, and ſinne, and corruption ſay, <hi>eat not,</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what Chriſt your Lord ſaith, <hi>[take and eat]</hi> and hearken not unto the voyce of of a ſtranger, if any ſay, eat not, Chriſt ſayes, eat; though the fears are great, and the tremblings many that are on a gracious heart, yet ſtill Chriſt biddeth them, <hi>[take and eat.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Chriſt knew the Saints would tremble, on the point of unworthineſs, therefore he ſaith, <hi>[take, eat]</hi> why what is it but <hi>my body that is broken for you;</hi> will you throw away that which is for you? but you are unworthy, why this is that which maketh you worthy; becauſe this is that out of which iſſues out all righteouſneſs to you: and though they may cry out, they were unfit, he commands them to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how fit Chriſt is for them; for whom is bread fit but for them that are weak, and need nouriſhment? for whom is that wine but him that is of a ſorrowful heart? for

For one whom the Lord hath been pleaſed, out of his free grace, to ſet his firſt love upon, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to follow with mercy upon mercy, and to give in one return upon the neck of another, notwithſtanding ſhe had often in the rebellion of her heart, ſaid, that God had covered all her prayers with a cloud, and would never anſwer any of them, which yet he hath abundantly done, which ſhe is not able any way ſufficiently to admire, or bleſſe his name for, and therefore deſires that thoſe whoſe hearts the Lord hath more inlarged to this glorious heavenly work,

               <p>There is one conviction more this day ſet upon my heart, from theſe words; <hi>if thou remember thy Brother hath ought againſt thee:</hi> (he doth not ſay, if thou haſt ought againſt him, but if he hath ought againſt thee) do thou ſeek reconciliation, yea, leave not till it be wrought out; from which the Lord not onely convinced me of this my duty, and told me I ſhould not ſuffer any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to lie in my heart againſt any, but alſo much comforted my heart under the ſight of this, as that which (through grace) I found the Lord had really wrought in my heart, and enabled me daily to practiſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Lord was pleaſed, in the miniſtery of his word, to convince my ſoul, that it is not the performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at ſet times, this is not all required, but when the ſoul is indeed pained under the ſenſe of its want of inlargedneſs to Chriſt, and the like, (that it cries out as the infant after the breaſt) &amp; is not ſatisfied with any thing without it, but the ſoul panteth

               <p>Which put my ſoul upon a ſearch into it ſelf, whether I were not guilty in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, after which I found I had been often guilty of the miſperformance of duties, doing them many times, eſpecially hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without this ſtrong panting, and ſenſe of my want.</p>

               <p>O my ſoul why ſhouldeſt thou ſay thou canſt not find love to God, when thou doſt ſo frequently, and reſtleſly, deſire the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and appearance of God, in every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and duty! if it be not for his own ſake, why doth not my ſoul ſit down and reſt contented with the ordinances themſelves?</p>

               <p>The Lord having thus appeared this morning, there aroſe in my heart a queſtion at noon, whether I ſhould not publickly by Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> offer up praiſes to the Lord for this appearance of his, but through many fears that aroſe upon my ſpirit leſt it might be miſconſtrued, as if I did deſire to appear to be ſomebody, with the like temptation was kept off, yet (notwithſtanding ſome trouble to my ſpirit, for I was greatly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to have bleſſed the Lord publickly for it,) yet how did the Lord appear in anſwer to this ſecret deſire of mine! For Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> himſelf, upon his own account, did largely bleſſe the Lord for his appearance in the midſt of the day, and ſo throughout, with which my heart did really cloſe, and ſo did our Siſter <hi>Arnal,</hi> as ſhe ſaid afterward, as well as my ſelf, greatly rejoycing that the Lord drew out his heart in that wherein her heart and mind alſo did ſo abundantly joyn.</p>
               <p>Our Brethen having made ſome entrance into the private conference, and ſomewhat of God appearing from ſeveral of them, my heart was much drawn out to propound ſome queſtions to them, having two or three
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:35177:73"/> things upon my ſpirit, wherein I was much unſatisfied, and having reſolved upon the thing in general, there aroſe a great diſpute in my ſpirit, which queſtion to propound firſt, (for they all left much weight upon my ſpirit) and amongſt others, I had a very ſtrong deſire to propound this, what means might be beſt available for the ſubduing of pride; and ſtrong debate had I in my ſpirit, before I could paſſe this over, yet, at the laſt my ſpirit was overcome to propound ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which proved very ſuitable to many other ſpirits, in which I ſaw ſome hand of God.</p>
               <p>Yet did my heart earneſtly long after ſome reſolutions concerning that of pride, but how gloriouly did the Lord a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (the 26 of this fourth moneth) appear in anſwer to it? ſhewing me, that there is no way like to the taking of the advantage of the ordinances, which the Lord enable me to do.</p>
               <p>About the end of this fourth moneth, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> ſomewhat aſtoniſhed at the paſſages of providence in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon which, for ſome time, he was very weak in praying for it, and ſeeking the Lord for them in place, which was a great trouble to my ſpirit, whereupon I made a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35177:73"/> draught of a letter to ſend to him, wherein I preſented him with my ſcattered thoughts, deſiring him to take a veiw of what he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us the laſt thankſgiving day, from that, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. 24. <hi>before they call I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> ſhewing, that God was ſo quick in his work in theſe latter dayes, that he often left his own behind, with ſome other ſuch hints, which letter I did not ſend, fearing to preſſe too farre upon my own ability in that kind.</p>
               <p>But how abundantly did the Lord anſwer thoſe deſires which were onely upon my heart, but not preſented at all ſave onely before the Lord? who was pleaſed to draw out his heart to mention them before him, and afterwards upon the 10 of the 6 moneth, (upon the occaſion of a day kept to ſeek the Lord for them) the Lord was pleaſed again to caſt in thoughts upon the ſame Scripture in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. 24. <hi>before they call I will anſwer,</hi> which was a real anſwer of my poor deſires, wherein the Lord ſhewed me, that the deſires I had were yet upon his heart, (for which bleſs the Lord O my ſoul) who, though thou didſt not preſs them, (thoſe deſires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred by ſome thoughts ariſing in my own mind,) yet was pleaſed to give me to ſee the deſired iſſue which thou didſt aim at.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:35177:74"/>
               <p>There was the 10 of the 6 moneth, at a private day of humiliation (we kept with reſpect to the publick affairs of the nation &amp; our ſelves) four papers of deſires put up to the Lord to Mr. <hi>Knight,</hi> theſe two firſt the Lord hath begun graciouſly to anſwer the tenth of this ſixth moneth: The firſt was this one, (to whom the Lord hath diſcovered from his word, what great advantages there are held out in it, to the cleanſing of the ſoul, and perfecting of holineſs in them, but the party not being able to diſcern them to be made real advantages to their ſouls, although (if their heart deceive them not) it is the great deſire and expectation of their ſouls to perfect holineſs, and the want of the ſight of it their continued burthen, which maketh them even cry out for deliverance, and for the accompliſhment of the time wherein they ſhall diſhonour God no more, but ſhall be made like unto him,) deſires your remembrance before the Lord to thoſe ends, that ſeeing his will is in thoſe things, and that the promiſe is ſo full concerning the accompliſhment of it, that he would pleaſe to diſcover to their ſouls why it is that the work goes ſo heavily on, and what ſhall be diſcovered to be the let, it may alſo by him be removed whatever it be, though
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:35177:74"/> in things never ſo near and dear, and their hearts ſupported and born up, and made ſubmiſſively-willing to lye down at his feet, to be made to do, to bear, to ſuffer, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any thing for his glory.</p>
               <p>But how graciouſly did the Lord (this ſame day being the tenth day of this ſixth moneth) begin to anſwer one main thing in this requeſt, diſcovering to my ſoul, that haply, one main end why he did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this work of holineſs in me, but ſuffer corruption ſtill to work, might be, that I might yet cry out more mightily to him; happly, I have not been ſo importunate in my deſires after ſanctification as after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and pardon, and the ſight of ſinne; and that the Lord would have me yet to cry more mightily and wreſtle it out with him, and reſolve to give him no reſt, yet not that I ſhould content my ſelf in pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out thoſe deſires to him, and ſo reſt there, (as was alſo hinted to me the ſame day) but to be watchful over my heart and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, watching and praying, calling and crying, untill the Lord appears, and not to think it enough to ſpread theſe deſires before, the Lord, and then give way to ſinne, and temptation, and corruption, and (as was the next day the eleventh of this 6 moneth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:35177:75"/> 1653. hinted to me) what was Gods end in diſcovering the power and ſtrength of ſin, but that we come more near to him, and by faith roul upon his covenant and promiſe for ſtrength againſt it? and, on the other ſide, what is Sathans end in ſetting home ſinne with the aggravations of it but to make us ſit down in diſcouragement? now, (O my ſoul) is it better for thee to accompliſh Gods end, or Sathans end? oh therefore cloſe in with God, &amp; beg power and ſtrength of him to do it.</p>
               <p>Nay, in farther anſwer, the Lord was pleaſed to enable me to expoſtulate with that unbelief, and firſt of my own heart, this eleventh day, ſaying, O my ſoul, is it not thy duty to beleeve; for is it not ſaid, <hi>bleſſed are they that beleeve?</hi> though thou ſee not luſt and corruption ſubdued by the eye of ſenſe, yet, O my ſoul, roul upon the Covenant and promiſe by faith, for <hi>faith is the ſubſtance of things not ſeen, and the evidence of things hoped for;</hi> therefore when thou come to be fully rid of this body of death, then faith ſhall ceaſe, and be of no uſe; but now is the time to act faith, when thou canſt, by the eye of ſenſe ſee nothing, but thy ſelf to be compaſſed in with a body of death and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:35177:75"/>
               <p>And for the want of the ſight of holineſs perfected in the fear of God, the Lord doth not onely diſcover that his will lies in this work, that it is his will even our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that we may well remember him with it, and pray as he teacheth us, that his will may be done, ſo it ſhall certainly be, but did the Lord diſcover to my ſoul (the eleventh of this moneth) that this alſo was part of the prayer of Chriſt, <hi>ſanctify them through thy truth, Joh.</hi> 17. and he ſaith in <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. ſpeaking at <hi>Laſazrus</hi> his grave; <hi>I thank thee, O Father, that thou haſt heard me alwayes, but I ſpeak it for their ſakes, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;</hi> now, (O my ſoul) if this be Chriſts prayer, and that as he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>not for the diſciples onely, but all that ſhould after beleeve,</hi> and if God heareth him in what ever he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as (he ſaith) he doth; then, O my ſoul, up and beleeve, for this work ſhall certainly go on.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the Lord did herein not onely anſwer to this, but to the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt alſo that was this day preſented, ſo that the Lord did anſwer them both, even as I did at once preſent them both, (bleſſed for ever be his name)</p>
               <p>Which gracious anſwer cauſed my ſoul the next day to preſent this ſhort deſire alſo
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35177:76"/> to Mr. <hi>Knight,</hi> to be put up to God in way of thanks, ſaying, one, whom the Lord hath been pleaſed (through rich grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) to hear, and anſwer ſince our laſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deſires to magnifie the name of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-hearing God, a God that delighteth in mercy, and in the manifeſtation of it to his poor worthleſs Creature, beſeeching him further to increaſe my faith, and help me to act it lively at this preſent in a plentifull feeding upon the Lord Jeſus, that ſo my ſoul may find abundant ſtrength, healing and cleanſing to iſſue from him in whom all my hope and help lyeth.</p>
               <p>The ſame tenth of this ſixth month, the ſecond paper that I put up this day was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our communion, which I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; One of this deſpiſed handful deſires, that the Lord would be pleaſed to humble our ſouls before him, that we have been guilty before him of raſhneſs, and inconſiderateneſs, together with want of love and tenderneſs to each other, which the Lord make every ſoul of us deeply ſenſible of, and help us to abound more to his praiſe in every good word and work, that we might never by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our weakneſſes and miſcarriages be any occaſion to darken his glory to the world.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which, the Lord was pleaſed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35177:76"/> in ſome meaſure, to draw out the heart of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to confeſſe this iniquity before the Lord with it, a ſenſe of and to mourn for one, who came in at the firſt, without due trial, (which I hope, not without ſome ground, the Lord hath ſet it home upon many if not all our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with adeepſenſe of our miſcarrage in it.)</p>
               <p>The tenth of the ſixth moneth, were the papers put up alſo to preſent to the Lord by Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> at a day of faſt, thus; One deſires your earneſt prayers before the Lord, and to ſpread the ſad condition of one in near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her, that conceiveth himſelf in a happy condition, when there are grounds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fear the contrary, ſhe deſires you together with her to beſeech the Lord to diſcover it to him, that ſo he may have no reſt in his ſoul, till he be brought home, and built upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that onely foundation.</p>
               <p>The ſame tenth of this ſixth Month 1653. one who was compaſſed with ſuch a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of death and corruption, (under which the party ſadly mourns) polluting all that ever ſhe puts her hand unto, therefore ſhe deſires your earneſt prayers to the Lord, that he would come and dwel in her ſoul, and be as a refiners fire and as fuller Sope to cleanſe her, and to burn up whatſoever is contrary to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35177:77"/> himſelf, or any way darkens his glory.</p>
               <p>The 13 of the ſixth moneth, The Lord drew out my heart exceedingly to beg an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of faith, even beyond ſight &amp; ſenſe, that though I could not ſee corruption dead, yet that I might beleeve that it ſhould be ſo in Gods time; as alſo to beg for our ſiſter <hi>Harris</hi> her Mother, and that the Lord would pleaſe to cure her of the fear of death, who had been ſubject to this bondage, and help her to commit her ſoul to him, as a faithful creatour, and an everlaſting loving tender-hearted Father.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth day of the ſixth moneth; was diſcovered to me, that I had often thought, that if I had but aſſurance of the love of God, then nothing could trouble me, but I ſhould be ſwallowed up with joy, and even overcome with it: but (Oh my ſoul) hath it been thus with thee ſince the Lord appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundantly in way of refreſhment to thee? or rather quite contrary, ſince thou haſt been ſet free from from the fear of hell and wrath, oh how ſad to think that ever thou ſhouldeſt live to rebel againſt ſuch a God, a Father of ſo much mercy.</p>
               <p>About the end of the ſeventh moneth, the Lord being pleaſed to lay ſome light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35177:77"/> upon my poor body, thereby drawing out my heart after this manner to him: Bleſſed Lord, what might thy ends be in thy fatherly chaſtiſements? oh that thou wouldſt diſcover it! and rather let this affliction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, continue, yea be increaſed, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented what thou wilt, rather then that the corruption ſhould not be diſcovered, and purged out; which requeſts were ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: Then was the Lord pleaſed in ſome meaſure, in anſwer hereunto, to diſcover thoſe things following to me, which I know not, but that he might much aim at; as might not the Lord have ſome reſpect to thy want of pity and compaſſion to one in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery? Might not the Lord lay his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, though not in that kind? nay were he not righteous if he ſhould lay the ſame ſtroke? haſt not thou deſerved it as wel as ſhe? might not the Lord do it to call thee home, and quicken thee from thy ſloth, deadneſs, &amp; dulneſs, and the eſtrangement of heart that was ſo faſt a growing between thy ſoul and the Lord? (O bleſſed father, ſaith my ſoul, let my corruptions be wrought out, and thy poor creature quickned.)</p>
               <p>Was not thy heart and affections exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly running out from the Lord to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? oh blened be that ſtroke that cals thee
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35177:78"/> back ſo that this work were but done by it.</p>
               <p>The third day of the eighth moneth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much oppreſſed in ſpirit with the thoughts of the diſhonour that would come to God, and ſcandal to the Goſpel, by the ſad falling of one of our brethren, and the fear that is upon my heart touching him:</p>
               <p>The Lord was pleaſed to draw out my heart this evening, to beg of him to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to our ſouls in generall, and to my ſoul in particular, what his ends were in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this poor handful together, telling him, I hope, he did not do it to make us the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his diſhonour to the world, and withall I was put upon it (I verily beleeve by the ſpirit of the Lord) in that ſame day to reflect back upon my own ſoul, what my ends were injoyning in that communion, and as I was preſſing the Lord to ſhew me why or to what end he had directed me to joyn in that ſocietie, telling him withal, that ſurely my deſires were to attend upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in it, and that if any other thing what ever did byaſſe my ſpirit in the act, that the Lord would pleaſe to diſcover it to me, whereupon I begged of the Lord that he would help me to examine my heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and that if I were byaſſed by any wrong reſpect, that the Lord would convince
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35177:78"/> me of it, and humble my ſoul deeply for it, and pardon it in Chriſts blood: now (O my ſoul) deal impartially in this work of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in this thing, and ſpread it before him.</p>

                     <p>SAthan having often beſet my ſoul to endeavour to keep it from a preſent participating in this holy ordinance, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral pretences, and having again now attempted it, I durſt no longer keep his counſell, but in the imparting of it I crave that help of your prayers at the throne of Grace, that the Lord would be pleaſed to diſappoint him in all his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35177:79"/> vices, that wherein he ſeeketh to do me hurt may prove the realleſt advantage of ſpiritual good to my ſoul, yet fearing whether it do indeed come from him or no, cauſeth ſome trembling upon my ſpirit, how to act; if it be a plot of his, it is a fair one, ariſing after this manner, having often found great appearances of God (as I hope I may ſay to his praiſe I have in other of his ordinances,) but finding my heart oftentimes very much ſhut up, as it were, and given over to deadneſs, dulneſs and heavineſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which was no way ſuitable to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual heart and ſoul-quickning ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and finding this very much to prevail, even at this preſent, deſiring your prayers, that the Lord would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me what to do, by diſcovering to my ſoul, whether indeed it doth ariſe from a ſubtilty of Sathan yea or no, or whether it be a lively alarum from heaven to my ſoul; thus trembling in my ſelf, whether my forbearance may not be found a yeilding to Sathan, or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35177:79"/> whether on the other ſide, I may not attempt and provoke the Lord by ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unpreparedly upon his holy things: thus deſiring to give up my ſelf into the hands of the Lord, waiting for the breathings of his ſpirit through the help of your prayers.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech the Lord alone to guide and lead my ſoul in all its motions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this preſent world, untill he ſhall bring it to a full enjoyment of himſelf in the perfection of holineſs, which my ſoul waiteth and longeth for, where I ſhall fully enjoy what now my poor ſoul hath but a tranſient taſte of, which the Lord accompliſh in his own time, and make me willing to wait my appointed time, until my change come, that when ever my Lord comes, I may be found watching.</p>
                     <p>The 10 of this 8 moneth (oh my ſoul) did not the Lord give me a gracious anſwer and return to this deſire and prayer forementioned, even whiles thou wert pouring out thy ſoul before the

For how can the Lord endure wickedneſs, any luſt, or corruption to poſſeſſe my heart, and take the Scepter out of his hand, and ſo to rule and reign over me? nay could my ſoul bear it to be thus over-powred, and to have my heart thus drawn from Chriſt, and thus captivated by ſinne and Sathan, when one word of his mouth could ſet my ſoul at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? beſeeching the Lord to ſearch me
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35177:80"/> and to try me, for he knew whether thoſe deſires and teares and groanes came from my heart yea or no; yea I know thou doſt ſearch me and knoweſt my heart, but Lord diſcover alſo to me and if there be any hypocriſy in my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in this regard, oh that thou wouldeſt anſwer me ſo by fire to conſume that droſſe and corruption in my ſoul, yea whatſoever thyrighteous eyeſeeth in me that is darkening to thy glory; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all telling the Lord how like a flood of mighty waters this corruption come in upon me, one wave following another, that I had no power to withſtand it, though he had diſcovered much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to my ſonl, and of the riches of his grace, and emptineſs of all other things, that yet my ſoul ſhould ſo run after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, beſeeching the Lord to give a real turn to all the affections of my ſoul, and to fix them upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, where they ſhall be ſure to be returned.</p>
                     <p>This was in the morning of the 10.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35177:81"/> day, then did the Lord further ſatisfie and quiet my heart in my Evening ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; that ſame day his ſpirit breathed in my ſoul after this manner: (dear Lord) oh that thou wouldeſt ſuppreſſe this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of murmuring under thy hand, and if thou wilt have thy poor creature ſtill to wreſtle and ſtrive under a body of death and corruption, and temptations and ſnares, and intanglements, oh that thou wouldſt help me in this work, that I may not yeild under it, but may hold out in a continual reſiſtance, and ſighing, and never give over, or making any peace with ſinne; and though thou doſt not ſee meet utterly to root out ſinne, yet (oh Lord) give it its deadly blow, let it be ſtill dying, and withering, and decaying, and work in my ſoul growing and increaſing, even untill thou haſt fully perfected it.</p>
                     <p>About the tenth of this eighth month, this experience was given in to my ſoul by the Lord, concerning Sathans deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my ſoul, and ſome refreſhments
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35177:81"/> to ſupport my ſpirit under it.</p>
                     <p>(Oh my ſoul) hath not Sathan dealt with thee concerning this great ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Lords ſupper, even as he hath formerly done concerning the great duty of prayer? how often hath he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to thee, that it is to no end to pray to the Lord, reaſoning thus with thee oftentimes, doſt thou think there is any ſuch God as thou prayeſt to, did he ever hear thee, or give thee any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of anſwer? why then doſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually appeal to him and pour out thy ſoul before him? and hath he not done juſt thus about this ordinance of the Lords Supper? thou wicked ſpirit, how often haſt thou been proved a lyar? what eminent tokens hath God given me of his hearing prayer from time to time, both concerning my ſelf, and others, and therein have proved thee a lyar? and why then (oh my ſoul) ſhouldſt thou not beleeve that Sathan will alſo prove a lyar in this? is not the Lord yeſterday, and to day, and for ever? is his arm

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:35177:83"/> him together with me, that he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to open any fountaines of love and mercy in this vale of teares, ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly fulfilling to my poor ſoul that word of his, which he was pleaſed no ſooner to ſet upon my heart with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, in ſome meaſure, that it ſhould be made good, rouling though weakly upon him for it, but that he was pleaſed ſo to do indeed, that word I found, Iſai. 56. 19. <hi>When the enemies ſhall come in like a flood, the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall ſet up a ſtandard againſt them,</hi> for which I deſire to bleſſe his name, beſeeching him that thoſe impreſſions that he was pleaſed by his ſpirit through ſeveral words of his, to make upon my heart, might never be forgotten by me, but that they might continually be as ſupports to my poor weak faith, that it may grow from ſtrength to ſtrength, even till I ſhall meet my God; bleſſed for ever be that God that was pleaſed to know my poor ſoul in this hour of temptation, and to take this poor lame ſoul, and lead, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35177:83"/> carry it of being not able to go one ſtep in any of his wayes without his hand, but that it getteth one knock or bruiſe or other; yea, bleſſed for ever be that God and Saviour, that will not ſuffer his poor creature to ſlip as he doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but was pleaſed, in rich mercy, to be ever awakening my poor drowſy ſpirit by one affliction or another; the thoughts of which do much refreſh my ſpirit, and ſeemeth at preſent a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial token of his love, for which I deſire to bleſſe him; and, oh that I could praiſe the name of that God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is the Father of all mercy and God of all conſolation; for truely I muſt needs ſay, I am perſwaded, Sathan had not now been let looſe to buffet me thus, had I not been ſo ſleepy and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in ſpirit; but bleſſed be that rod that awakned my poor ſoul from the ſleep of any ſinne, ſo that the Lord will but pleaſe to work it out, (which I deſire to wait on God for.)</p>
                     <p>I ſhould (for ſome reſpect) have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:35177:84"/> this duty of praiſe, but that the Lord hath let in the clear ſight of this mercy; as alſo leſt I ſhould prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful for ſo large manifeſtation of mercy, though all I can do in it is a meer nothing, the greater is the goodneſs of God that bowes down to accept ſuch broken praiſes, which I have cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to lament over, having too little ſpiritual life in them, when as in truth, my whole ſoul and body ſhould be a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lively ſacrifice to God, which the Lord inable me to do to that God, whence all my enjoyments come, in whom I deſire to reſt your unworthy, but in deſire and hope real friend, for my Lords ſake.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord was pleaſed to help me very much in this ſearch by Mr. <hi>Knight,</hi> who ſpake from this Scripture at <hi>Fulham,</hi> the ninth of this ninth Moneth.</p>
                  <p>In the 12 of <hi>Luke,</hi> 42, 43. from which he ſhewed, We have the Lord ſetting out the bleſſedneſſe of that ſervant that is faithful in the work that his Lord intruſteth him about;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:35177:86"/> and whom his Lord when he comes findeth to be ſo doing as he appointed.</p>
                  <p>Now (O my ſoul) what comfortable hopes canſt thou gather out from the ſerious exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thy own heart, upon this point, that the Lord hath made thee faithful though thou art poor, weak, and unworthy every way to be the ſervant of ſuch a Lord: what canſt thou ſay to this? hath the Lord indeed made thee faithful?</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I gather ſome hopes of it, that the Lord hath made me in ſome meaſure faithful, from that ſincerity that the Lord hath put into my heart to aim purely at his glory in all I do in this world: the contrary to which cauſeth much bitterneſs in my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; yet through the prevalency of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part in me, I am, many times, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed and carried aſide to aim at other things, in many of my wayes; but the glory of my Lord is my principal aim. For (if I know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of my own heart) through mercy, I do find it ſet to ſeek the honour of Chriſt, and to walk in wayes well pleaſing to him, though I do too often ſadly wander from theſe intents and deſires, which was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the real burthen of my life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that the Lord hath been pleaſed to put into my ſoul (I hope) a real deſire te do
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:35177:86"/> his whole will, and therein to appear faithful, daily deſiring and begging of him, that I might not at any time in any command of his be found conſulting with fleſh and blood, but that as ſoon as ever he diſcovereth his wils in any thing whatever to me, that he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo inable me to obey it readily.</p>
                  <p>Finding the Spirit of the Lord (I hope) oftentimes breathing in my ſoul, after this manner: Lord, if thou wilt but diſcover thy minde &amp; will to me in all my wayes; that is it I beg of thee, and though it be never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to fleſh and blood; yea, though I can ſee nothing, but that it is laid out for to afflict me, and to be a trial, and exerciſe for me; and ſo have nothing to induce me but thy will: yet, Lord, if thou wilt but diſcover thy minde in it to me, what would I then beg of thee, but onely a ready frame to yield obedience to thy will, and leave the ſucceſs &amp; ſanctifying of it to me, to thy ſelf: and if on the other ſide I think any mercy to be never ſo good, or for my advantage, yet if thou ſeeſt meet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to my ſoul that thy will is not in it, would I not then (if I know my own heart) beg above all things, to have my will to be wholly ſwallowed up into thine, Lord? And this hope is grounded (in ſome meaſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the abundant experience the Lord hath
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:35177:87"/> given me of his goodneſs and mercy, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant kindneſs in his often denying me of my will.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 I hope the Lord hath (in ſome meaſure) made me a faithful Servant in that he hath ſet my ſoul upon the watch, to know his minde and will, indeavouring and deſiring to keep my eye upon him, and him only, that I might ſee what his minde and will is, who hath ſaid, <hi>that he will guide his by his eye:</hi> which cauſeth my ſoul (though with much weakneſſe) not onely earneſtly to deſire, but alſo to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reflect upon all my motions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thoughts, and words in this world, to ſee with what countenance, my Lord look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon this and the other action, being (I hope) deſirous, I am ſure (if my heart deceive me not) to ſee the will of my God, in every promiſe, providence, and adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The Lord hath made me faithful, in that he hath put into my ſoul this earneſt deſire, that my ends in all I do might onely be to ſeek the advancement of him, my Lord, whom I deſire only to ſerve, daily begging of him I might no more live to my ſelf, as I have too much, and have too long done yea, when I finde any thing of my ſelf or ſelf-ends to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear or break forth, though but in the buds, is it not bitter to my ſoul? and ſuch as imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:35177:87"/> the beſt action to me; though, otherwiſe never ſo good? And this deſire of ſerving the Lord, I may upon experience ſay, I finde to differ not only from that ſlaviſh fear that is in others, (I will not ſay ſo) though I ſuppoſe it to be true alſo, but from that ſlaviſh fear that did too much predominate in my own poor ſoul, which did, in the time of my bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, cauſe me to fear rather then love him; but now the Lord hath (in ſome meaſure) been ſcrewing up my obedience to an higher note or pin, that it is now to a Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom at laſt, I would love. And I do alſo lament before him, in the ſincerity of my ſoul, that I can love him no more, who have ſo much lovelineſs in him, yea nothing but lovelineſs: yea, it is a ſervice of a Lord who wills all, and maketh the law, and maketh it to be juſt; becauſe he can do no evil: and I would I could continually meditate upon this his will, but this is it I daily preſs after, and mourn under the want of the clear ſight of this, that there ſhould be ſo much fear in my heart concerning the iſſue or event of any thing, wherein my Lord ſhall be pleaſed at any time to declare his will to lie in.</p>

                     <hi>Further diſcoveries of Faithfulneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faithfulneſs appears in the reality of the heart, ſerving the Lord with all the heart, ſoul, and ſtrength; and ſo faithfulneſs in prayer lieth not in the pouring out of words, though with ſome affection, but doing it with all the heart, ſoul, and ſtrength, and a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of every grace to the utmoſt in every ſervice I do for Chriſt. And (O my ſoul) is not this that thou daily preſſeſt after, though thou canſt not fully attain unto it? what elſe maketh thee to mourn over thy prayers and duties, but that thou findeſt no more of thy heart and ſtrength in them? Is not thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant deſire, that all thy ſoul and ſtrength might be offered up to God in every ſervice thou doeſt him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are faithful ſervants of Chriſt, that do all they do in order to a truſt from Chriſt, who intruſteth them with his Ordinances, with their health, wealth, comforts, injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all I have is but a truſt from Chriſt; now to be faithful is to improve this truſt to God, to do all the good that poſſible I can by his Ordinances, to do every ſervice to him, as they that indeed exerciſe a point of truſt, he intruſting me with his glory in this world:
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:35177:88"/> faithfulneſs is to make the utmoſt advantage to raiſe up his glory in this world &amp; make him appear great; And ſo faithfulneſs in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the graces that God and Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſteth me with, by improving of them, to make the utmoſt advantage for him; and ſo for health, and all outward comforts.</p>
                  <p>Now (O my ſoul) hath not the Lord writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this in thy very heart? that all that ever thou haſt, and enjoyeſt, both ſpiritual and temporal, whether ordinances, graces, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, all thy enjoyments that thou haſt by truſt from Chriſt, and muſt be improved for him, and not ſpent upon thy ſelf, or this world? and doth not the thoughts of this make thee daily mourn before the Lord, that thou canſt not improve them better, that he hath ſo little revenue of glory from thee, and by thee? but that ſo much of his ſtock lies as it were dead, and unimproved, doth not the ſight of this cauſe thee to mourn daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that he ſhould intruſt thee with ſo much, and receive from thee ſo little?</p>
                  <p>Now (O my ſoul) doth not the thoughts of this make thee cry daily out to the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to reveal his mind &amp; will to thee, how he would have thee improve this or that other mercy or truſt committed to thee; and not onely teach thee his will in it, but alſo
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:35177:89"/> help thee to improve it to his glory conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually?</p>
                  <p>Yea (O my ſoul) is there not a continued fear upon thy heart, which cauſeth thee often times to pour out ſtrong cryes before the Lord, that he would help thee to give him the glory of all the mercy and good things he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſteth thee with at any time; as alſo that there might never be found in thee any back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs or unwillingneſs to give up thy truſt in any thing whatever into his own hands, when ever he ſees meet to call for it? which ſeemeth to note a further degree of faithfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Further diſcoveries of Faithfulneſs at the ſame time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 Faithfulneſs appears in the generality of it, when a man is faithful in all that he hath, though all that he hath be but a little; and truly herein I have great cauſe to lament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; for in the ſtead of being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all that I have, there is much unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in me, that appears in all that the Lord truſteth me with, and yet (O my ſoul) maieſt thou not alſo ſay, that there is ſome degree of this faithfulneſs, or at leaſt a deſire after it in thee; and maieſt thou not ſay, By this law
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:35177:89"/> of thy Lord, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth of the Law of God in general; <hi>With my mind I even my ſelf ſerve this Law of God</hi> in faithfulneſs, <hi>though in my fleſh I do too often rebel againſt it?</hi> which is my daily burthen, from which evil in thy own time, deliver me, oh my God, and this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to wait for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faithfulneſs appears in being faithful, notwithſtanding all difficulties that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them in their ſervices. Now (O my ſoul) haſt thou not abundantly cauſe to give glory to God that hath been pleaſed to make thee thus faithful in any degree, or meaſure in this reſpect, who by his own hand &amp; power hath carried thee through many a reproach, and ſcoff, and ſcorn, and by words making thee like <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was ſtill perſecuted by <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> and hath not this been thy Lot by ſome, ever reproaching thee, ſcoffing, deriding thee, backbiting, ſpeaking evil abundantly of thee, and yet falſly, doing their utmoſt to bring thee out of favour with thoſe whoſe love thou highly priſeſt, and have reaſon for it? And how did the Lord make thee to lie down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, when others taxed thee of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and the like to ſearch thy own heart, and bemoan before the Lord the degrees of it, which thou ſaweſt through mercy by others (though not viſibly to them)? Thus did the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:35177:90"/> Lord bring a good iſſue out of their own ſpeeches and words, cauſing thee to lie down at his foot, expecting the puniſhment of thine iniquity. Yea, greater difficultie then theſe hath the Lord carried thee through when all the powers of Hell and thy own Corruptions have combined together to keep thee from duties of Prayer, Meditation and Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the like; and yet the Lord hath ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thee to break through all, and to pour out thy ſoul to him when thou wert even in thy own apprehenſions at the Pits brink, and yet reſolved to cry to him, and not to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver crying, and calling whilſt thou liveſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all temptations to the contrary; yea, the more ſtrong the temptations were, the more ſpeedily wert thou fain to addreſs to the Lord for his ſtrength and power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt thee in grapling with them; yea, when ſome times overcame as it were, and beaten down by Satan, and entring the very borders of deſpair; yet even thence from this belly of hel in which thou didſt apprehend thy ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready entred; did not the Lord inable thee to cry to him, &amp; reſolve to give him no reſt? Yea, when thou foundeſt no advantage or profit of all thy Prayers, and Tears, &amp; Sighs, &amp; Croans, but that the Lord ſeemed to turn a deaf ear; yet did not the Lord enable thee to go
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:35177:90"/> on, and to tell him that all thoſe comforts and enjoyment here below they were poor mean things, ſuch as thou couldeſt not take for thy portion? and therefore didſt beg with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his wil, That if he had no other for thee but the portion of this life, that he would pleaſe to deny thee them alſo, and never give them to be a ſnare, but rather let thee end thy dayes in ſome deſolate Wilderneſs?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faithfulneſs appears in cheerful ſervice: Now (O my ſoul) art thou not able to ſay before the Lord the ſearcher of hearts, through his grace, that ſo much faithfulneſs as thou canſt diſcern in thee in any ſervice of thy Lord, is thy very joy and rejoicing of thy heart; but on the other ſide, ſo much unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs as thou canſt diſcern in any ſervice; this is it that maketh thee go mourning all thy dayes, becauſe thou art no more fruitful.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. (O my ſoul) thy faithfulneſs in ſome meaſure appears, in that thou art rejoiced really in ſpirit when any opportunity is put into thy hand, and thy heart being enabled in any meaſure to improve it to the ſervice, and for the glory of thy Lord; and art thou not (on the contrary) grieved that thou haſt ſo many opportunities offered before thee, but (like a fool) haſt not a heart to improve them for the glory of thy Lord; is not this thy day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:35177:91"/> burthen? Lord thou knoweſt it is; &amp; when, through the ſubtilty of Satan, and deceit of my own heart, I fool away many rich oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities by not improving of them, which after proved a ſad burthen and affliction to me.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. O my ſoul, doth there not appear ſome degree of faithfulneſs to thy Lord, in that thy endeavours do come ſtill beneath thy deſires; hath not the Lord really enabled thee through grace to ſay with <hi>Paul The good that I would do, I do not:</hi> But, O that I could do it, that I could ſerve the Lord more and better; but, oh! how low do I live? and how poorly do I walk? but oh that I could come to Prayer, and read, and hear, and meditate, and do all private and publike duties, and walk in all my Relations in this world, as might honor this my Lord; are not theſe the continual groans and breathings of my heart before the Lord? (Lord thou knoweſt it) for I have none I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to appeal unto, but to thee the ſearcher of my heart.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Lord, doth not ſome faithfulneſs appear to be wrought in my ſoul by thee, in that thou haſt above all things made me to delight in that work that no eye ſees but thy ſelf? Thou knoweſt what a fear hath been upon my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and is to this day in a great meaſure to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:35177:91"/> before others; thou Lord knoweſt how many years this fear hath been as a priſon to keep in the workings of my heart; &amp; as doors to my mouth, to keept it from lamenting it ſelf, not ſo much as in one word in the hearing of others, leſt there ſhould any pride or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie act in it; yea to this very day, how many ſervices wherein perhaps thy Lord might be honoured; art thou prevented, and durſt not to act in upon this very accompt that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done in private; canſt thou not ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſearcher of hearts, That ſuch thoughts and apprehenſions, and fears as theſe, leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould eſteem thee better then thou art, or thy own ſpirit be lifted up before the Lord, or any falſe ends byaſſe thee in it? That ſuch thoughts I ſay as thefe do often as it were tye up thy tongue, ſow up thy mouth in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, even whiles at that inſtant thy heart is even ready to ſplit or break in pieces for want of vent; ſometimes apprehending that thoſe diſcoveries that the Lord was pleaſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to make to thee, and the rich grace he is pleaſed to manifeſt in thee, in overcoming all the unkindneſs in thee, ought not to be put unnder a buſhel, but held out to others; and yet not daring to do it, finding my wretched heart ſo prone to be lifted up upon all ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and ſo diſhonor God that way; and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:35177:92"/> ſo deceive others and my ſelf alſo: And through both theſe fears my ſoul often walks ſadly before the Lord, fearing to offend him, and not being able to diſcern it whether way I might moſt honor him, having made trial of both, ſometimes ſilent, and ſometimes ſpake; and finding the wickedneſs of my heart appear ſadly in both, I knew not ſometimes which was beſt; the Lord in mercy manifeſt and clear up to me.</p>
                  <p>(O my ſoul) Thus may it probably and hopefully appear to thee that the Lord hath made thee in ſome meaſure his faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord hath given me ſome hopes that (I truſt) I have no other Maſter that I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or willingly ſerve, but my Lord Jeſus; nor have I any other work that I do, upon which my heart is delightfully ſet upon, but only my Lords work; and this appears far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to me, in that the Lord hath (I hope in ſome meaſure) wrought my heart to this frame of ſpirit, to deſire above all things to ſerve my Lord Chriſt in all the Relations he hath ſet me in, in this world; and to that end every failing in any of them, either as a child or friend, or any Relation (though I too ſadly fail in them all) this is that (which if my heart deceive me not) above all things breaketh my
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:35177:92"/> heart to think that hereby I do diſhonor my Lord Jeſus, and that profeſſion of being his ſervant: It is not ſo much that I offend any Relation, as that I grieve the ſpirit of God in all my actions, and in all my Relations in this world; I hope that my ſoul is in the firſt place ſet to ſerve my Lord in the duties to them, as that which he requires, and my be for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor if done rightly; and though I do often tranſgreſs the commands of my Lord Jeſus, yet I truſt I do not make it my work, but it my daylie burthen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. My deſires and daylie grones before the Lord are, that I might be wholly devoted and given up to Jeſus in my whole inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; and I would that all my poor parts, and ſtrength, and time, yea all my inward and outward Talents ſhould be improved in his ſervice wholly; how often doth my ſoul breath before the Lord after this manner! (Oh Father) is it not long enough, yea too too long that I have been too too much at Satans beck and the worlds, yea and mine own? Oh that it might be thus no longer, and that I might no longer live to my ſelf, or ſeek or pleaſe my ſelf in any thing, but that my whole ſoul may be ſet to pleaſe my Lord Jeſus; is it not my daylie burthen that I have too too much ſought and ſerved my ſelf, both in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:35177:93"/> natural and ſpiritual things, that I have had too many ſelf-ends and deſignes (which the Lord crucifie, fully for my Lords ſake!) and as for the ſervice of the world (if I know any thing of mine own heart) it is my daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, prayer and indeavour, to throw the world wholly out of my heart, That I might not do any ſervice any longer to ſin, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; and if at any time they do get any lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from me, how grudgingly and repiningly is it done? yea, is it not the grief of my ſoul, that I have had any expectation or deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any thing in the world, or of this world; that my eye is not wholly and really upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for expectation, proviſion, and all what I need?</p>

Though I have a wretched heart that hath, and ſtill would be picking its work, thinking that other ſervants of Chriſt they have an eaſier work, and go through this world filled filled with the joy of the Holy Ghoſt; yea, and have their cups of earthly bleſſings overflowing; and hereupon my wicked heart hath been carried diſorderly to long after and wiſh for ſuch a condition; and think, that I had a hard portion, to be always afflicted with inward and outward diſtempers and weakneſſes, trials in bodily afflictions of

                  <p>Secondly, Another thing the Lord was pleaſed ſometimes to make a means to humble my ſoul, was the conſideration of this, That the defects in all my ſervices of him ariſe not ſo much from without, no, nor from all the powers of Satan and Hell, as from within, as from the corruption of my own heart; and this maketh me often cry out before the Lord of the body of death; O wretched creature that I am! the good that I would, that do I not; but the evil that I hate, that I do?</p>

                  <p>Lord, ſhall ſay that theſe things do hold forth in any meaſure my faithfulneſs to thee?

                  <p>And novv (father) what are thoſe requeſts that thou vvilt hear? haſt thou not ſaid, what ever we ask in thy Sons name thou wilt hear;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:35177:103"/> vvhy, in thy Sons name I deſire to come; for J have nothing elſe to plead, there is nothing in me, but for thy Sons ſake, the Son of thy boſome and love, who died for poor ſinners, ſuch as thy poor vvorm is; for his ſake, and in his Name J come unto thee; and thou haſt ſaid, whatſoever we ask according to thy vvill thou wilt hear: Novv (Lord is not this agreeable to thy will, to be conformed more to thee? and have my vvill more ſubjected to thee? and my affections more placed upon thee?

                  <p>The eighteenth of this twelfth moneth, having been theſe eight or nine days laſt paſt ſomewhat diſtempered in body, which diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per prevailing more and more upon me, J thought J ſhould hardly be able to wait upon the Lord in his adminiſtrations the next day, deſiring the Lord to direct me what to do, and ſubmit my will to his; yet, very early that morning J had many reaſonings in my ſelf what to do, being loth to diſtruſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, that J had ſo often found eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held out to me, and yet unwilling to tempt the Lord to appear to me in any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:35177:103"/> way, deſiring much his direction: at laſt the Lord was pleaſed to enable me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to go, notwithſtanding I was exceeding ill of an extraordinary cold, beſeeching the Lord to appear to my ſoul; and as he was pleaſed to give me that probability of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him once more, that it might be a bleſſed opportunity to my ſoul, and that his mighty power and ſpirit might accompany e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word and hint to my ſoul, that it might be of ſpiritual advantage to me, ſuch as I might have cauſe to bleſs his name for, and alſo to mould me into whatever truth hee ſhould reveal to me that day; And truly I deſire to acknowledge that the nineteenth day of this twelfth moneth, the Lord was pleaſed very gloriouſly to appear through his word adminiſtred by our deer Paſtor, both in the expoſition of the end of the 14. of <hi>Matt.</hi> as alſo in both Sermons this day, at which time he began to diſcourſe upon the 45 <hi>Pſalm;</hi> but did only handle the Title of it this day, from which the Lord was pleaſed to hint out very precious, glorious, uſeful, yea ſeaſonable inſtructions to my ſoul, which I deſire earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly to beg of God to caſt and mould my heart into; yea, ſuch truths as proved an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſeveral deſires of my ſoul many dayes before, and to the groanings of my ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:35177:104"/> the Lord, even continually almoſt, to wit, that the Lord would be pleaſed to gather my heart out of all things below Jeſus Chriſt, and give me to the end ſuch a ſight of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as might indeed) take my heart from all other things; now that at this time the Lord ſhould thus ſeaſonably caſt his thoughts upon ſuch a Scripture as this, it did cauſe my ſoul to admire the riches of his grace and condiſcention to ſuch a worm; yea, whereas my ſpirit hath of late been greatly troubled about my fooliſh converſation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſuch as may any way adorn the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, walking very unſeemly in all my relations, and very much offending therein vvith my tongue, vvhich hath occaſioned many a ſad thought upon my heart, and many a ſigh and groan, yea tears before the Lord, to ſet a vvatch before my mouth, and ſubdue this vvicked iniquity in me.</p>
                  <p>And now did the Lord this day lay open the ſpring, the root, the cauſe of it, my eye was not as it ought upon my heart, nor my heart as it ought to be upon Jeſus Chriſt, nor when it was upon him was it in a boyling frame: for (as by him hinted) were the heart boyling hot about the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the tongue could not iſſue out ſuch vanities as it
<pb n="923" facs="tcp:35177:104"/> doth; novv (dear Lord) let not theſe things be ſpread before me in vain I beſeech thee, but do thou by the mighty Power of thy ſpirit make them of ſingular uſe unto me.</p>
                  <p>The 11th. of this firſt Month the Lord drew out my heart very much (amongſt other things) to beg of him to manifeſt himſelf in that Relation of an Husband to my ſoul, more and more letting me to find and feel what it was experimentally to be imbraced by him, and gathered up into more intimate communion with him, and much more to this effect.</p>
                  <p>The next morning he cauſed my ſoul to breath out in this manner; That though I was every vvay unfit for communion with him, yet beſeeching him to appear to my ſoul, and a ſight of himſelf would much rejoice my heart, telling him that as he had often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared gloriouſly in this kind, ſo that he would pleaſe to let my ſoul find once again by experience his mighty power to break out through what ever inſtruments he ſhall pleaſe to make uſe of this day, that I might through them have a glorious ſight of himſelf. In which the Lord was pleaſed greatly to bow down, appearing graciouſly through Mr. <hi>Price,</hi> who ſpake to us in his Name the 12. day of this firſt Month.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:35177:105"/>
                  <p>Upon the 26. day of this firſt Month, 1654. we went to <hi>James,</hi> expecting to have heard Mr. <hi>Cradock;</hi> but when we came there, we heard there would be a ſtranger, at which I was much troubled in my ſpirit; and after ſome debate in my ſelf I began to repine; but expecting the Lord might have ſome ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Word for me; and truly (bleſſed be his Name) there was many ſeaſonable things hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my ſoul by him, which both refreſhed &amp; ſtayed my ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The next day at night (being the 27 of this firſt Month) Amongſt other things when I was ſeeking of the Lord, he drew out my ſoul with ſome meaſure of ſenſibleneſs of his hand upon our Paſtor, vvhat a ſad ſtroke it vvould be if the Lord ſhould ſtrip us of him, taking him from us; oh! What vvould become of Gods glory? how vvould his and our enemies inſult over us? though it is true vve have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it [I am ſure I have] to be ſtripped of this mercy, and ſcattered from each other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vve have been no more fruitful under all the mercies, means, and appearances of God through him; and I begged to ſanctifie his hand upon him, both as to him and us, &amp; teach us all to improve it and know his mind in it, deſiring the Lord vvithal that he vvould
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:35177:105"/> pleaſe to haſten and accompliſh his Work through this diſpenſation, and in his own time to command health and deliverance to us, and give in this mercy as a pledge of his love amongſt us, that he might come again amongſt us filled vvith the ſpirit, and ready to break out thoſe diſcoveries of God upon his heart, and that vve alſo may be fitted for this mercy, and made more ready to receive impreſſion from God through him then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
                  <p>And for my own ſoul after many requeſts for the ſubduing of corruptions, and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my affections, and taking off my heart from all things here below, and placing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord Jeſus; after which and many other requeſts, the Lord drew out my heart with deſires, that if the Lord ſaw it meet to add another night or another day to me, that he would together with it, give me a heart to ſerve him in it, and that as he reneweth the light and raiſeth from ſleep, ſo that he would inliven my heart in his waies, and quicken up my ſoul to a more lively ſervice of him, and if the Lord ſee it meet to give me one opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity more to hear his word, that he would pleaſe to fit me for, it and to come in through whatſoever inſtrument he ſhall pleaſe, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:35177:106"/> my ſoul might have ſuch a bleſſed ſight of him, that I might thereby be changed more into his own Image.</p>
                  <p>The 2. day of the 2.

                  <p>Having extream deſire to go and heare Mr. <hi>Cradock</hi> the next day, I told my Mother over night, perſwading her to it, ſhe having very urgent occaſions; but at laſt prevailing, I found my ſelf very much diſtempered next morning with a great cold which I had got; notwithſtanding which, I got up, but before I was quite dreſſed I had ſuch a ſtitch took me in my back in ſuch an extream manner, that I knevv not how to lean any way; it was in ſuch an extream manner which held me for the ſpace of two hours continually, almoſt until it was full time to go; in all which time I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned ſtil with my ſelf what I ſhold do, fearing I ſhould not hold out that journy, nor be able when I was there to ſit to hear becauſe of it; yet at laſt having had ſuch experience of God formerly, I did deſire now to rol upon him, &amp; betook me to ſome ſhort deſires to him, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him if he ſaw it good, to give me ſo much inward and outward ſtrength as might at this time inable me to honor and glorifie him; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly begging his appearance to my ſoul, quickning and raiſing it, conforming it more to himſelf; with many other deſires relating to my ſpiritual condition; and how ſeaſonably

                  <p>COnſidering the vanity of all creatures compared with the Lord, what is there in the creature deſirable? the beſt of men (vvhich are the beſt of creatures) are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe then vanity; they are but a ſhadow compared vvith the ſubſtance; nay, they are but dark ſhadows; now what wiſe creature is taken much with a ſhadovv? what is there in creatures, the beſt of creatures (man himſelf) that is deſirable? as for beauty, that is vanity of vanities; the rareſt thing in this vanity ſhould no way take upon a gracious ſpirit that was raiſed up to higher things; but (to go to the utmoſt hight) the beſt things and moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:35177:108"/> in the beſt of men is their reſemblances of, or likeneſs unto the Lord; yet in this they are but like unto pictures, yea dark ones; now who would be much taken vvith the Picture, that might at the ſame time enjoy the thing that is pictured; yet ſome Pictures made by the hand of man, may in appearance far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in beauty and lovelineſs the thing pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and herein the beſt of creatures are but dark, dead low reſemblances, yea very poor ones of the eternal God. Pictures are often deſired becauſe of the fading, uncertain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the thing pictured, which often times fadeth before the Picture; but what creature comes near to the repreſentation of God? the Picture quickly fadeth and dyes, but the ſubſtance is eternal.</p>
                  <p>Who then would deſire, or be over-much taken with ſuch a Picture that perhaps ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fair to day but fadeth to morrow, which is the condition of all finite creatures? but that infinite God is an everlaſting Father, the Lord Jeſus an ever-living Interceder, and the Spirit of Truth an abiding Comforter; yea, in every Relation wherein the Lord is pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf, he is that to his to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
                  <p>Yea, as Pictures are poor, dead, uſeleſs things in compariſon of the perſon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:35177:108"/> only a delighting the eye; ſuch are the very beſt of creatures compared with the Lord; can they ſpeak if he be ſilent? can they effect ought if he withdraw? Can they ſmile if he frown? Can they refreſh if he rebuke? Can they heal if he wound? Can they raiſe up if he caſt down? There is neither any life or motion in them ſeparated from him; they have eyes, but ſee not; ears, but hear not; hands, but act not; feet, but walk not; tongues, but ſpeak not to any ſpiritual advantage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he that is the life of their lives puts life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all theſe, and when he hath done, acts in, through, by and with them.</p>

                  <p>The Lord having been pleaſed to hint out to me by Mr. <hi>Bramble</hi> (the 9th. of the ſecond Month, 1654.) that the Lord vvas pleaſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in mercy to appoint ſome weariſom nights and dayes to his people, wherein they could not take any reſt, that ſo they might call their own hearts to an account ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and the like; which I pondering upon, and thinking with my ſelf how eminent the Lord hath appeared to my ſoul in former dayes, in the Night-ſeaſons, and how ſweet my Meditation of him hath been Night and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:35177:109"/> Morning upon my Bed; and how barren my heart hath been for ſome time of late in theſe Meditations, and how the Lord hath ſeemed to withdraw; theſe thoughts did put me upon it (the tenth of this ſecond Month) in the Evening to beg of God, that as he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly appeared in ſuch ſeaſons, that he would pleaſe to return that mercy even by thoſe torches of his hand, whereby my Nights are very weariſome to my body by reaſon of my extream Cough; &amp; truly I did the more preſs it upon the Lord in my deſires, having much groaned to think that Night would be very weariſom to me more then any formerly by reaſon of my diſtemper; but my good God, who worketh all things after the counſel of his own Will, and not according to our thoughts, or fears, or hopes, ſo ordered it, that what I had reaſon moſt to fear, he gave me leaſt to feel, and though I was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered in my head, when I vvent to bed by reaſon of my cold that vvas ſo great, yet did he give me very good reſt, all the fore-part of the night; vvhich vvhen I avvaked tovvards morning and began to conſider, Oh, I could not but admire; but vvithal began to think that though my deſires about this vvere an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvered, and though I had reſt of body, yet no communion vvith my God, or reaſonings
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:35177:109"/> with my own heart (which I intended to have parlyed a little with;) while I had theſe thoughts and the like, lying in a ſlumbering vvay, there vvas this thought brought to my mind, which Mr. <hi>Cradock</hi> (the fourth day of this ſecond Month) mentioned upon another occaſion; the words were theſe, <hi>That vain man would be wiſe that was born like a wild Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Colt:</hi> Theſe words ran much in my mind, and ſome thoughts were given in upon them, with a great deſire I might not forget them, but might in the Morning ſee and finde out that place of Scripture; but the Lord giving me (as I thought an opportunity) and ſo much ſtrength as to go and hear Mr. <hi>Cradick,</hi> I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, as ſoon as I could get up, to prepare for going; but when we came there, having pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord in ſome few words, that he would pleaſe to give me ſome ſight of himſelf, ſome transforming ſight, and ſome kiſſes from his lips this day; but going there we were diſappointed; for that exerciſe was for ſome occaſions put off to next morning, and ſo we came home again; and coming home, being a little ſadned in my ſpirit, thinking of my Morning-deſires, &amp; when an anſwer ſhould be of them, or how looked for, I ſate me down, and fell to reading a little of Mr. <hi>Cradocks</hi>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:35177:110"/> Sermon before mentioned; and meeting with theſe vvords, <hi>Oh vain man that would be wiſe,</hi> put me again in mind of my Night-thoughts, and fell to looking the Scripture, and found it in <hi>Job</hi> 11. 12. <hi>For vain man would be wiſe though man be born like a wild Aſſes Colt;</hi> ſome hints there were that fell upon my heart this night from theſe vvords, <hi>Vain man would be wiſe:</hi> (Good God!) hath not this been my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? this poor vain creature, would I not fain be wiſe, and thought to be ſo, and often pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my ſelf in the thoughts of it, for which the Lord righteouſly ſhevvs me novv and then my folly; yet how fain would I be wiſe in chalking out Waies for the Lord to walk in tovvards me, even as if I knew better what were good for me then God, or how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that Work in my ſoul better then he, and therefore am I ſo ready to preſcribe to him Wayes; yea and if he refuſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them (as for the moſt part he is pleaſed in mercy to do, bleſſed be his Name.) Oh! how ſadly doth it often lie upon my ſpirit, and how apt am I to think hardly of the Lord, that truly he doth not mean me any good in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me this or that I deſire.</p>
                  <p>And for the later vvords, <hi>though man be born like a wild Aſſe Colt;</hi> concerning vvhich I had ſome ſcattered thoughts, but not ſo compoſed
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:35177:110"/> as afterwards. But after I had come home from <hi>James</hi> next day, and had looked this Scripture, and found it, ſitting and pauſing a vvhile upon it (my ſpirit being very much ſadned and unfit for any ſerious ſpiritual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation) at laſt I betook my ſelf to ſome ſhort requeſts to the Lord, telling him, That as he vvas pleaſed thus to diſappoint my expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publike enjoyment, yet in him there was a fulneſs of all povver and ability, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by being as able to ſpeak to me by his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſomething that might be of ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſome transforming vvords which he is able to do as vvell in private as in publike, which I did now beg of him, and to that end beſought him to lead me by the hand this day, and guide me into the Way, and put me upon the Work, and that he would pleaſe to appear to me, with many other requeſts both for my own ſoul, and others in relation to me. But not knowing vvhat Work to ſet upon this day, or what to take in hand, but waiting upon the Lords direction, having many things in my thoughts to do, but deſirous of ſome vvord from God to my poor ſoul; but this vvord in <hi>Job</hi> 11. 12. following me ſtill, I fell to ſome further thoughts of it, and ruminating on the latter clauſe, of <hi>being like the wild Aſſe,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think what that Scripture did record of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:35177:111"/> this creature that I ſaw did reſemble me fully, and there theſe words of the Prophet brought to my minde that it went up and down ſnuffing up the Wind, and is ready to be found in her moneth; which words I found in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 2. 24. <hi>A wild Aſſe uſed to the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs that ſnuffeth up the wind at her pleaſure, in her occaſion, who can turn her away? all theſe that ſeek her will weary themſelves, in her Month they ſhall find her.</hi> In which, as alſo in moſt part of the chapter, I find many things that ſate very cloſe to me, the Lord began: thus it was with me, for in <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>I remember</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the kindneſt of thy youth, the love of thine eſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after me in the Wilderneſs in a Land that was not ſown;</hi> In the time of thy darkneſs, ſorrows, and tears, and bondage; when thou wenteſt after me, and often in the bitterneſs of thy ſoul reſolved to follow me through this Wilderneſs, though thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt periſh in ſo doing; yea, reſolving ſo to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me as that thy heart was then fully, as it vvere, taken off from all but me, thou didſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing but my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me that you go from me to follow after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi> How righteouſly may the Lord ſay thus to me, vvas he not better to me by far then ever I expected, or could have believed? <hi>v.</hi> 6.

                  <p>Oh good Lord! What need then had we poor creatures to ſeek of thee to teach ſouls what and how to pray? for truly we know not what to pray; nay when thou comeſt in anſwer even to our own importunate deſires; how unable are we to bear the anſwer of our ovvn Prayers?

                  <p>The 20 day of this ſecond Month, 1654. having ſought the Lord that he would breath in by his ſpirit upon my ſoul, and give me

                  <p>There were theſe hints fell upon my heart ſoon after, that I had been very remiſs in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving thoſe precious &amp; glorious appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God to my ſoul (through our dear Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor) that ſo nearly concerned me from that 45. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and that therefore the Lord had juſtly laid him aſide for a time, even whileſt he vvas entring into it. (O bleſſed Lord) haſt thou watched over me in the time of my childhood, vanity, unregeneracie, when I knew not my right hand from my left; &amp; haſt thou been with me ever ſince to this day? and ſhould I now diſtruſt thee, or fear that thou ſhouldeſt now leave me to my ſelf? (O curſed unbelief!) haſt thou vvatched over me theſe ſix and twenty years, and ſuffered no evil to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake me, but made all things to work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for my good; and ſhould I now fear and miſtruſt thy love?</p>
                  <p>Haſt thou provided for me to this day that no good hath been wanting to me? and ſhall I novv diſtruſt thee, or think thou wilt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any thing thou ſeeſt good for me? Nay, Haſt thou not vvith-held me from evil that would have hurt me? and muſt I now mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, repine and cry out of thy want of love

                  <p>Haſt thou overcome death and hell for me, that I am not novv in that ſlaviſh fear of them as formerly I have been? and ſhall I ſtill fear that thou wilt not overcome my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for me? (O curſed unbelief!)</p>
                  <p>The 23. day of the ſecond Month, 1654. In the Morning being much diſcouraged in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to any hopes of Gods appearance, having heard but ſlender commendations of him that was to ſpeak this day; yet being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to look up to the Lord, I beſought him that he would pleaſe to give my ſoul ſome ſight of himſelf, and communion with him; and that as I had former experiences from him, that the inſtrument was nothing if he would pleaſe to undertake the work; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſought him that his povver might ſo appear that my ſoul might have a ſight of him, and there might be ſome ſeaſonable word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that might do my ſoul good; and truly I muſt needs acknowledge the Lord was pleaſed graciouſly to bow dovvn and manifeſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence exceedingly beyond my expectation this day.</p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:35177:116"/>
                  <p>The fourth day of this third Month, 1654. being to take a portion of Phyſick, I beſought the Lord that it might accompliſh his will and pleaſure upon me; and if that lay in health, that it might be ſanctified to me; if in ſickneſs, that my vvill might be bowed and ſubmitted to his will.</p>
                  <p>The 7. day of this third Month, at night the Lord drew out myheart to beg of him amongſt other requeſts, that he would pardon all my miſ-ſpent time, and help me to improve what ever time he ſhould ſee mete to give me, more to his praiſe and glory; and to that end, if he ſhould ſee mete to give me to enjoy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, and ſee the beginning of a new Week, that he would alſo give me a new heart, and a new ſpirit, and help me to walk more to his praiſe, improving time better then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning, (being the 8. of this third Month) I beſought the Lord for his preſence that day, notwithſtanding all my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs and unworthineſs of it, with much to that effect: And truly the Lord was pleaſed greatly to bow down, and ſpake many ſweet and ſeaſonable things to my ſoul, both through that ſervant of his Mr: <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:35177:116"/> that preached that day at <hi>Fulham,</hi> as alſo by his ſpirit, through ſome Scripture then hinted unto us, which cauſed my ſoul that night to breath out before the Lord, deſiring to bleſs him for it, yet lamenting my unprofitableneſs under ſuch glorious appearances of his, and miſ-improvement of them; lamenting alſo the great iniquity of my tongue, beſeeching the Lord now to ſet a Watch before my mouth, and to keep the door of my lips, as alſo my heart.</p>
                  <p>The 13. of this third Month, in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as I was going down, I had a ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe upon my ſpirit to ſpeak a few words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord before I went down; at which time my heart was greatly drawn out to ſpeak to God to curſe, and blaſt, and root out of my heart theſe bitter Roots. Pride, Paſſion, and inordinate Affections, in a ſpecial manner that of Paſſion; he firſt drew out my heart in this addreſs to God, finding it ſo ſadly prevailing, telling the Lord that he had often ſhewed me the evil of this both from the Scriptures time after time, coming ſometimes with mighty power upon my heart, &amp; yet going off again; yea, he had appeared againſt all theſe evils in many experiences of the folly and vanity of them, eſpecially thoſe of Pride and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:35177:117"/> affections; how often had he ſhewed me the emptineſs of all creatures, yea in the very things I expected moſt from? And how often had he blaſted my pride by theſe continual ſcoffs I met Mithal, and by all thoſe infirmities upon my body, for all which I deſire to bleſs his Name, beſeeching him once to ſpeak effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to my heart, to the utter ruine of theſe evils in me.</p>
                  <p>The 24. day of this fourth Month, being in my Cloſet, the Lord drew out my heart to pray that he would pleaſe to manifeſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and drop ſomething upon my heart that might be for my ſpiritual good and advantage; in anſwer thereunto the Lord was pleaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly to caſt me upon this Scripture, the 40. of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>

                  <p>Some hints from the Lord at Mr. <hi>Thorns</hi> about the end of the 5 Month 1654 which I know not but may be an anſwer of former pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>
                  <p>May-be thou wouldeſt honour God in one way and condition and he would have thee to honour him in another; yea, may-be he would have thee honour him by living by faith, roul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him for the ſubduing of thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in the mean time will be honoured by continual ſtrugling and fighting with them. O my ſoule! haſt thou not often (yea, oh how often!) tempted the Lord ſadly concerning this; and the Lord grant it may be the laſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many ſolemn reſolutions, and promiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, never to provoke him thus any more, and yet to do it again; yea might not the Lord do this even in anſwer to prayer? thou having begged of him that morning to give and order all thy words and actions that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:35177:126"/> day: oh that God would at laſt make thee wiſe, and ſo order thy ſpirit, and ſubdue this riſing of corruption, ſo as thou maiſt never more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him in this kind!</p>
                  <p>Vpon the 6 of this 6 month, 1654. The Lorddrew out my heart in the morning to ſeek of him that he would be pleaſed to bow down and appeare gloriouſly and gratiouſly to, and through his ſervant, Mr Knight, who had but the day before at Fulham Chappel ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly preſſed us to ſeek the Lord for him, which wrought upon my heart greatly, to begg of God that he might find the fruit of the prayers of his people on his behalf: As alſo, that my poor ſoule and others that did appeare to meet that morning might have a gratious viſit from him that none of all my unfittneſs to attend upon him, or unfruitfullneſs under former ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances might hinder his gratious preſence with, and to my ſoul this day; but that though there was nothing in me to move him to it, yet that he would doe it for his own name and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſake that my ſoul might have ſuch a light of him as might conform me more and more to him.</p>
                  <p>And how graciouſly was the Lord pleaſd to bow down this day as a God hearing prayer! &amp; that firſt on the behalf of his ſervant, Mr Knight, that was to ſpeak this day in his name? how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:35177:127"/> did hee appeare, not only through his Poor worms, but even in him alſo, greatly drawing out his heart both in prayer &amp; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In prayer, and therein begging of God, in the entrance of his ſervices, his preſence, and mightily (in a way of faith) rouling upon him for an anſwer of prayer even at this preſent ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>The 27 of this 6 Month being the Lords day, and finding my heart very dead and cold all the week, and alſo now very unprepared to meet the Lord or expect any appearance at all from him, I did yet in a few ſhort deſires preſent my requeſt to him, beging his mighty preſence, unvailing the Lord Ieſus, (both to and through his ſervant) to our poor ſouls, beſeeching him alſo that I might have a clear ſight of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, and that he would pleaſe to appear a God, nay and not a God a far off, telling him withal that my poor ſoul had found him to be ſo, notwithſtanding all my unfitneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, beſeeching him even now to make it appear to my ſoul, that he is a God hearing prayer, and that he would give my ſoul a very glorious ſight of my Lord Ieſus, and not only diſcover him to me, but cauſe theſe diſcoveries to work with mighty power upon my heart, really taking it off from all other things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, and fix it wholy upon himſelfe: with
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:35177:127"/> many other requeſts of this nature.</p>
                  <p>But yet notwithſtanding, my heart was ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what (I thought) affected with thoſe deſires before the Lord, yet (oh with what ſadneſs, I may ſpeak it,) how ſoon were they out of mind even before I got to Tulham; in ſo much that I quite forgot my own deſires, and not at all looking after any anſwer of them; but how did the Lord raiſe and rouſe up my dead heart, even upon the nameing of the pſalm that was called to be ſung in the morning, which was the 145. pſalm, which at the firſt nameing of, my heart leaped as it were thinking, what! ſhal we ſing that pſalm Mr <hi>Knights</hi> text is in? though for the preſent I miſtook; for his text is in the 45 pſalm, but this was the 145. pſalm &amp; the two laſt ſtaves, which as ſoon as wee began to ſing my heart was exceedingly altered with it, in which I found many ſuteable expreſſions to my former deſires, even in the very words, which did as it were raiſe my heart in a kind of contented expectation of a glorius appearance of God that day, as a returne of prayer, which methoughts the Lord did even then give to me by hinting this ſcripture ſo put to my condition and deſires; and how gloriouſly did the Lord appear the 27. of this 6. month through his ſervant, Mr <hi>Knight</hi> in both parts of the day, whom he was pleaſed to come in, even beyond
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:35177:128"/> his owne expectation, as he acknowledged to me in diſcourſe the next day, telling me that he did only intend to handle in general the 3 things concerning Chriſt, as his ſvveetneſs, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; faithfulneſs; but when he came to ſpeak to them the Lord was pleaſed ſo greatly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the thoughts of it upon his heart, and made it ſo ſvveet unto him, that he could not but declare vvhat the Lord gave in unto him; and truly not only vvas it ſvveet to him, but as fit and ſeaſonabe to my poore ſoul as any thing that could have been ſpoken; the Lord give me but a heart to make improvement of it, ſo as may be to his praiſe, and eternal good of my poore ſoul;</p>
                  <p>The 7 day of the Month; hovv abundantly vvas the Lord pleaſed to bovv dovvn to this rebellious wretch, who hath great cauſe to fear, that my heart was ſet more to ſeek &amp; ſee a poor vain creature &amp; to meet w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> them, then to ſee or meet the Lord, &amp; yet that the Lord ſhould, even now, bow down and give forth gratious viſites to my ſoul through many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible convictions hinted to my heart this day, both through his word, and through his other adminiſtrations, this day going early enough to heare the morning ſermon, though I much fear, whether it were ſo much out of pure love to it, as out of ſelf-ends, yet what ſenſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions did there from the Lord fall upon my
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:35177:128"/> hart from theſe inſtructions M. <hi>Blond</hi> hinted out to us from the expreſſion of <hi>David, I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity!</hi> where hee ſhewed us that it was our great duty to watch cheifly againſt our own particular ſinns, ſhewing us, how wee might know them, hinting alſo that it was Probable that this ſinne of <hi>David</hi> vvas tongue-ſin, from vvhich hovv ſecretly did the Lord check my poor ſoul! aftervvards Mr <hi>Nie</hi> ſpake from pſalm the 50. 26: <hi>this thou didſt and I kept ſilence,</hi> vvhere hee ſhevved that by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence vvas meant a refraining from motion or action: vvhence he obſerved, that vvords and actions are all one vvith God it vvas as eaſy vvith God to do as to ſpeak; it vvas but for him to ſpeak and the vvork vvas done; yea it is as eaſy for God to do as for us to ſpeak, and begg of him, and much more; and vvhat a mighty incouragement is this to thy faith, O my ſoul! vvhich vvas the improvement he made of it by application, and alſo hinted more, that as all Gods vvords are actions, and ſo pardoning actions and adminiſtrations are as ſo many vvords; and oh of vvhat uſe is this to my ſoul! vvhat things hath God ſpoken to my ſoul from, and by his various adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to thee for theſe many years! hovv hath the Lord by his providence often as it were convinced thee, and yet thy baſe heart
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:35177:129"/> will not leave to goe on to tempt the Lord, though he hath ſo evidently appeared in croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee, and this day was a ſign of it, that thou wouldeſt put on thy beſt cloathes in that pride and vanity of thy heart, thou know'ſt; didſt thou not by a ſtrange providence as it were, get a ſpot in thy coat to check thee, and did not the Lord by it ſhew thee thy pride, vanity, and folly? but, Oh how grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the Lord that he will pleaſe to ſhew thee this in ſo mild and gentle a way!</p>
                  <p>The 10. of this 7 month, being the Lords day, I ſought the Lord in the morning, (but in a formall way) that he would pleaſe to appear to me that day through his ſervant, as alſo to give in a gratious anſwer to theſe deſires that Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> put up to him the laſt day, namely, to unvail the grace of our Lord Jeſus to him that he might ſo taſte and feel it, as might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to declare it to his praiſe, which I did now alſo beg of the Lord, and that, though I was altogether unworthy of this mercy, or of any more appearance from the Lord, which have made ſo little improvement of ſo many gratious favours, yet that he would pleaſe to overcome my rebellion and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs with his love, and at the laſt over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er my ſoul, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:35177:129"/> to record to the Praiſe of the Lord, is before him, and that yet the Lord was pleaſed moſt particulary to unvaile the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the riches of his grace; the Lord help thee, O my ſoul to improve all thoſe wondefull appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of his praiſe and glory.</p>
                  <p>The 13. of this 7 Month appointed by this new Parliament, for a day of humiliation and ſeeking the Lord, I ſought the Lord in the morning that he would pleaſe to put my heart into ſome meaſure of ſuteableneſs to that buſineſs, and to make mee really ſenſible of all my rebellions, unfruitfulneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs to him for all his glorious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and that he would poure out his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon his ſervants that were to be his and our mouthes this day, as alſo begging the Lord to let ſome hints from himſelfe fall with power upon my heart this day, and there abide; And (bleſſed God) how gratiously wert thou pleaſed to appeare, and with what ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſuteable truths, preſſing my ſoul to get into Chriſt, and dwel there, then which there is no truth more needfull to be preſſed upon my vvretched heart, being ſo miſerably ſhattered about and upon other things, and my affections ſo ſadly divided, that (in truth) I doe not dwell in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as I ought, which the Lord vvas pleaſed in great

                  <p>The 24. of this 7 Month being the Lords day, I was in expectation to have heard Mr. <hi>Knight;</hi> but when I came to <hi>Fulham</hi> there was a ſtranger, and when I heard him to pray ſo ſtrangely, I was ſtruck with an exceeding damp, wiſhing my ſelf ſomewhere elſe, yet deſiring to ſtill my ſpirit, and to wait upon the Lord, who is able to hint out ſomewhat that might be of advantage to me, he ſpake from <hi>Joh</hi> 5. 25. in which he ſhewed us, that men might be alive naturally, and yet dead ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and ſo preſſed us to the tryal of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, which I thought might be a call from God to check me for my neglect in this work, and to put me upon that duty he tells us, that God was the life of the ſoule, as the ſoule was the life of the body, and when God was departed from the ſoul, it was dead, and that which maketh God depart is ſin, proved from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 2. In which Scripture (me thought) the Lord did ſecretly hint to my ſoul, that my ſin was the cauſe of all the

                  <p>The 25. of this 7. month, The Lord in the morning drew out my heart to beg of him, that he would pleaſe to be preſent that day, being to go to my Aunt <hi>Doggets,</hi> to guide and direct me in all my words, and actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome what diſtracted and diſturbed in my own thoughts and mind, and not ſo content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſubmitting to all the providences of God, as I ought to do; and after ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and hot diſpute at dinner, between Mr. <hi>Aldgate</hi> and my ſelfe (at which time I dealt plainly with him according to my poor meaſure) after which Mrs. <hi>Aldgate</hi> (very unexpectedly from me, and unuſually from her) was very earneſt to have me go and read in a litle book of hers, concerning content: Marvelling in my mind at this ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual thing in her, looking upon it as ſome providence happily to me, who had ſeen the book before, but looked upon it in a ſlight curſory way, and not with any valuation of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:35177:131"/> it, yet now, I thought, that happily the Lord might have ſome thing to ſpeak to me out of it, and ſo I took the book and went to reading therein, for an hour or more; and truly the Lord was pleaſed to lead me to moſt ſenſible and ſeaſonable things, to the frame of my wretched ſpirit, by which it convinced me, that I did not contentedly ſubmit to his will in all conditions; for if I did, then there would be a ſilence in my ſpirit, yea a joyful frame of ſpirit, yea a continued giving thanks to him, and many ſuch like things by way of diſcovery; together with many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible directions, and inſtructions, which I deſire to acknowledg as a mercy, beging that the Lord would make theſe hints effectual to my ſoule.</p>

               <p>The 8. of this 9.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:35177:135"/> did hee appeare to my ſoul, and what a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able word was hinted out this day to mee by our deare brother. the 25 of this Month at evening as alſo the 26. day in the morning, (being the Lords day) finding my heart excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dead, and dull, and altogether unfit to meet the Lord, as alſo greatly oppreſſed at the ſight of the prevalencie of corruption, and temptation over me (almoſt continually) which occaſioned my ſoul to pour out its ſelf greatly before the Lord, in ſundry &amp; various petitions relating to my preſent condition, as alſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begging his preſence, both in the preparing my heart to meet with him, and in fitting ſome bleſſed word, wherein he might meet my poor ſoul, with many requeſts to this purpoſe, too large to relate, and both touching my own ſoul, and alſo his ſervant that was to ſpeak that day, and behold how gloriouſly, O my ſoul, did the Lord appeare through his ſervant (our dear paſtor) who ſpake from the 45. Pſal: <hi>thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the Scepter of thy Kingdome is a right Scepter,</hi> where he ſhewed us, that Chriſts Scepter, (by which he rules and orders all his affaires in the world, and in his Church,) is a right Scepter, and that all his adminiſtrations are managed by a right ſtraight line, for the Glory of his father and the good of his poor creatures and that, how
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:35177:135"/> ever through the darkneſs of our hearts, and our unpeliefe, wee could not ſee the ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all Chriſts adminiſtrations, yet, that they are ſo hovvever; for God the Father who beſt knows them, ſaith ſo of them, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us alſo, that however Saints are apt to think that there is none in ſuch a ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they, ſo tempted, and ſo overcome by corruptions and vain thoughts, and the like; and if Chriſt did indeed raign in them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them and his Scepter thus right, why is it then thus with them? in anſwer to which, he ſhewed us, that Chriſts Scepter was right ſtill, becauſe his deſign was through all this to raiſe up his own and his fathers glory; as his skill appears moſt that maketh a glorious piece out of a crooked thing, ſo Chriſt hath ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of glory, by working through all our afflictions and temptations to magnifie his grace and mercy towards ſuch as we are; yea, to do us good through all: now, dear Father, hath not thy rich grace ſhined gloriouſly in this condeſcention, to ſuch a poor worthleſs wretch as I am? This day alſo did the Lord call us, ſeeing his <hi>Throne and Kingdome is for ever and ever,</hi> to look after everlaſting things, a ſecret check to my ſoul in it, ſo eagerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing after fading dying things; yea, if Chriſts kingdome be everlaſting, ſo alſo are thoſe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:35177:136"/> that are his ſubjects, from whence we were farther exhorted to look out what it is that we have that is everlaſting, telling us that wives, and children, and eſtates, and the like, they are not everlaſting, they and you muſt part: Oh therefore do not reckon theſe everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; but if you have a Chriſt, or grace, &amp;c. that ſhall be everlaſting; if God hath begun any good work in your ſouls, that ſhall be everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; your infirmities, weakneſſes, corruptions, they are not everlaſting, they ſhall die and wither, and Satan ſhall ſhortly be trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your feet; though Satan and ſin hath domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neered, and made a ſtir in thy ſoul, yet it ſhall not reign for ever there, but grace ſhall raign by righteouſneſſe to eternal life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though your pains be great, troubles ſore, temptations many, yet know they are not everlaſting, and this may much comfort the Saints; yea, if Chriſt raigns, this may comfort the Saints, that their afflictions ſhall paſs only from Chriſt, not from the ſons of men, not from the world, nor Satan, nor the Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; no, nor the reſtleſſe motions of your hearts that often miſgive, and terrifie you; your judgement ſhall paſſe from Chriſt, whoſe Throne is for ever and ever. O my ſoul, how abundantly hath the Lord bovved dovvn to refreſh, as vvell as convince thee this day? the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:35177:136"/> Lord grant it may abide upon thy ſpirit, and help thee to live continually to his praiſe.</p>
               <p>The 29. of this 9. moneth, I ſought the Lord to appear to my poor ſoul, and ſpeak ſome ſeaſonable word that might be for my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantage; and truly, though I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of him that I expected to hear, yet, did the Lord by our btother <hi>Lemall,</hi> hand out a moſt ſeaſonable word to my ſoul, which I deſire may abide, which was, not to quench the ſpirit, which the Lord did really convince me that I had often done, even of late, which I deſire the Lord would help me againſt, and make this a bleſſed word to the end, unto my ſoul.</p>
               <p>The 30. day of this 9. moneth, the Lord drew out my heart that morning, to beg of him that he would pleaſe to prepare my heart to meet with him and to manifeſt his preſence to my poor ſoul, through his Word, that it might be a bleſſed ſeaſon, wherein my ſoul might enjoy communion with himſelf; and that, to that end, he would pleaſe to remove out of my ſoul whatever might make me unfit to meet with him, deſiring much in my heart, and endeavouring to expreſſe it before the Lord, that my heart might once be gathered out from all things here below, and ſixed only upon himſelf, and Jeſus Chriſt, and that there
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:35177:137"/> might be ſomething added to this work this day And, O my ſoul; how gloriouſly did the Lord appear, both for thy conviction and comfort, in ſending his meſſenger, as if it were on purpoſe with an errand from heaven to my ſoul? It was a ſtranger that preached this day, and the Subject he was upon, was the lovelineſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Canticles</hi> 5. 16. <hi>He is altogether lovely;</hi> whence he fully clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there was nothing below Chriſt that can be lovely or deſirable, and vvhatſoever could be deſired; it is abundantly in him; from vvhence the Lord did really convince me of my folly in ſuffering of my affections to run out ſo ſtrongly on ſuch vain objects, and ſo little on my Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and in the cloſe, ſpeaking by vvay of comfort, he had this paſſage, That vvhen ever any poor ſoul did come into the preſence of the Lord in prayer, or hearing, or any ordinance, vvith a deſire to have ſuch a corruption mortified, (though for ends, beſt knovvn to the Lord, he may for the preſent ſuffer it in him, yet) vvould he record it in heaven, as if it had been mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, for (ſaid he) it vvas in the deſire of that poor ſoul, and though I ſuffer it, yet I look upon it, as if the ſoul had mortified it really, and ſo for all other gracious deſires, the Lord looketh upon them as his, and as done,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:35177:137"/> though never attained, as he did <hi>Abrahams</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and therefore he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it upon record to poſterity, that he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him up, though yet he did not do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it vvas in his heart and intent to do it, had not the Lord prevented; vvhich toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many other pretious hints the Lord was pleaſed to leave with me this day, which I beſeech him to bleſſe me, and make me to improve them to his praiſe and glory.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day of this 10. moneth, I ſought the Lord that he would be pleaſed, if he ſaw meet to add one other day to me, to vouchſafe his face and preſence to me, and give my ſoul ſome ſight of him, and prepare my heart to meet with him, emptying out of it what ever might unfit me to come before him, after which there fell a great damp upon my ſpirit, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that I had only in a formality ſought this of him, but could not expect that he ſhould continue alwayes ſo graciouſly to a poor ſoul, as I had begged of him, being ſuch an unworthy, unfruitful creature that did ſo little improve all his appearances: but, O my ſoul, how gloriouſly did the Lord break through all thy unbelief, and go beyond all thy expectations, in providing a moſt bleſſed, glorious and ſeaſonable word for thy ſoul, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the deſires of thy heart; alſo on the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:35177:138"/> behalf of his ſervant, that was to ſpeak in his name this day! ſhining forth gloriouſly in and through him, inſomuch that himſelf did bleſs the Lord for his appearance that day; for which bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and oh that all that is within me could bleſſe his holy name! Oh the ſenſible truths that were hinted to my ſoul this day, which I deſire of the Lord I might never forget, which were hinted from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. from which our Paſtor ſweetly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the love of Chriſt to righteouſneſſe, which love (he ſhewed us) was that that made him lovely to God and to his Saints. Now that he doth love as he ſhewed us, appears in that this love to it was his very nature, and therefore he is called <hi>the righteous,</hi> and <hi>the Lord our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> yea, it appears, in that he hath through all kind of difficulties fulfilled all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; therefore with deſire I have deſired (ſaith he) to eat this paſſeover, that ſo he might be ready to ſuffer, and ſo to ſatisfie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice, which is one part of his fulfilling righteouſneſſe; yea, he ſhewed, that he loves righteouſneſſe in that ſalvation that he hath vvrought for us, meriting by a full ſatisfaction to juſtice, that ſo juſtice might glory in our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as vvell as mercy; for hovvever were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all by grace, yet Chriſt wrought it out by juſtice and payd a full price for it, which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:35177:138"/> ſhewed his love to righteouſneſs and juſtice; ſo that what ever God hath promiſed believers in his word, it is a merited promiſe, that Chriſt hath bought and paid for; yea given the full worth of it into the hands of God, ſo that juſtice can never ſay, that what we receive by grace is not fully ſatisfied for, but that we have now a right by juſtice to every promiſe in the book of God, as well as by mercy: (oh bleſſed word!)</p>
               <p>Yea, he loves righteouſneſs, becauſe he maketh all righteous, who are accepted of him by his righteouſneſs: And firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By forming their hearts to his likeneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By imputing to them his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yea, he ſhewed that he loves righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the terrible execution of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on unrighteouſneſs: now all this, as it maketh Chriſt lovely to the Father, ſo it muſt needs make him lovely to his Saints, and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they could never look on, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold divine juſtice without being confounded, if they did not behold it ſatisfied through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to glory as well in the juſtice, as in the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:35177:139"/> mercy of God, and plead with God, as well as he is a righteous and juſt God, as he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe all that is beautiful in the Saints, either in themſelves or others, is from this Chriſt; therefore, Chriſt himſelf muſt needs be lovely to them, becauſe that which often ſupports the Saints hearts is not ſo much their actings in righteouſneſs, as their love to righteouſneſs; <hi>David</hi> cryes not out, oh how do I keep thy Law! but oh how do I love thy Law! therefore needs muſt Chriſt be lovely for his righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt muſt needs be lovely, for his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of righteouſneſs, becauſe through this he hath made a way for us to eternal life? how doth he bring about this way of life, or keep us in this path of life? but by a way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. laſt. It is not ſo much that grace reigneth as that grace reigneth now by righteouſneſs (or juſtice) to eternal life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That uſe that was made of all this was very precious, we being inſtructed hence to take a due view of Chriſt, to behold him more; for we are ſaid to be changhed into his likeneſs while we behold him, ſo that the reaſon we are no more like to Chriſt is, becauſe we live no more in the ſight of his righteouſneſs
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:35177:139"/> which would but ſhew us our own unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and nothing can do it more then this beholding Chriſts righteouſneſs, and then reflecting back upon our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2, The beholding Chriſt would make us like Chriſt; for our aſſimulation to Chriſt comes from our being raviſhed much with looking on Chriſt; the devil hath no greater deſigne, then to keep the Saints from beholding of Chriſt, he will let them pore upon their own luſts or any thing elſe rather then this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſight of Chriſts righteouſneſs is a ground for the ſtrongeſt conſolation to Saints that can be, of which, when the Apoſtle had got a ſight, he cries out, <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect,</hi> ſeeing through Chriſt righteouſneſs juſtice is ſatisfied, what can ſin, the devil, luſts, corruptions, or law do? they cannot condemn for Chriſt juſtifieth.</p>
               <p>Oh what refreſhments were held out from this bleſſed truth of Chriſt his loving righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! now if Chriſt doth love righteouſneſs, then he loves to do juſtice; and to be righteous in all his adminiſtrations, both of grace and puniſhment, yea, he loves fidelity in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is another part of righteouſneſs; oh put this to the end of every promiſe in Scripture! that Chriſt loves righteouſneſs, and ſo loves more to performe it then thou canſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:35177:140"/> deſire to have it performed: as Chriſt loves righteouſneſs, ſo he loves to fulfil all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and that by doing and ſuffering, though it were a hard work: then it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us further, that all the grace you receive comes from the hand of juſtice, how may the Saints then go boldly to the father and ask no more then what Chriſt have already paide for? ſo that the Saints living on the promiſe is no beggerly buſineſs, for there is not one of them but is throughly payd for by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo may be pleaded for, not only upon that account of mercy and grace, but even of juſtice and righteouſneſs. O that God would cauſe all theſe bleſſed truths to have an abiding pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon my ſoul!</p>
               <p>The 6. of this 10. month over night, I ſought the Lord that he would pleaſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſome ſeaſonable word for my ſoul, as alſo begging his gracious appearance, through his ſervant that was to ſpeak, with much to this purpoſe; and (O my ſoul) how graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly was the Lord pleaſed to appear to thee this day! the ſcripture he ſpake from by our dear paſtor, was the 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1. 12. whence he ſhewed us, what a ground of joy is the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good conſcience; when it witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in ſincerity: whence he ſhewed us, that the work of conſcience is to witneſs to every
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:35177:140"/> action of a man, both religious and civil, and not only doth it bear witneſs of every act, but of the meaſure, and of the manner of heart-workings in the act, and ſo witneſſeth either the righteouſneſs and ſincerity of it, or the ſinfulneſs of it, yea, and the ſpring of all our ſinfulneſs; our rejoycing (ſaith the Apoſtle) is not that we preach, pray or the like, but that our conſcience witneſſeth, that what ever we do though never ſo weakly &amp; imperfectly, yet its done in Godly ſimplicity, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a ſingle intention, aiming purely at the glory of God, that there is no double dealing, not a heart for God, and for our ſelves too; yea, we were ſhewen, that conſcience was not only a witneſs, but a judge; therefore where it findeth the act good, but the principle naught, it tells that man (if he hearkens to it) that all is naught, and that God will not be ſerved with leaves, but with fruit; and thus it paſſeth ſentence and judgement; from which how ſecretly did the Lord check my ſoule? then he ſhewed us, that conſcience had a ſtrong memory, though we forget yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will remember, not only acts, but circumſtances; which (O my ſoul) mayeſt thou not clearly teſtifie the truth hereof by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience? yea, it was hinted to us, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was a juſt and right witneſs, all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:35177:141"/> in hell and men on earth cannot make it ſpeak other then truth; the devil may, and doth abuſe conſcience by imitating it, and ſo ſuggeſting this or that to a ſoul, as if it came from conſcience, when it coms immediatly from hell: even Saints themſelves may paſs wrong judgement upon their brethren as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends did; but conſcience is a better witneſs then Saints themſelves, and it was ſo to <hi>Job,</hi> yea conſcienc was held out to be a convincing witneſs; where it doth witneſs againſt ſin, it witneſſeth convincingly, cauſing them to groan under it; yea it was held out to be a bold witneſs, that will not be daunted any way, and muſt needs be ſo becauſe God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf imboldens it to ſpeak plainly, as that thou art an hypocrite, or afraid to hear what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſaith; Oh how ſweetly was this truth improved this day by application! as firſt, to teach us to admire the goodneſs of God in placing ſuch a witneſs in every mans boſom, yea how good it was for the Saints that this was ſet up in wicked men, for ſome times there are actions done by wicked men againſt Gods people, that there is no wineſs but their own conſciences, which teſtifie againſt them, of all their hard ſpeeches and thoughts, and words and the like; yea how good was it for the Saints alſo in this! for had they not this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:35177:141"/> in themſelves, how bitter would the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the World be to them? We were exhorted to take heed how we walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſcience, it being by God ſet as a Watch over us; oh then take heed that we withdraw not from it! Nay, it is true it will follow you; but labour to keep it in your ſight, and when you are to do any civil or religious Work, call it in, and ſay, Conſcience, What ſayeſt thou to this or that action? Was it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will and mind of God? and give it leave to ſpeak out; yea and give time alſo; for oftentimes the affairs of the World hinder, that conſcience hath not time to ſpeak its mind.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To take heed we grieve it not; for its complaints will be heard in Heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed of doing any thing againſt conſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Awe it as a Judge, and be content to be judged by it in all you do, for it will be your Judge another day, and will be an immortal Witneſs either in point of comfort or terror; oh therefore awe it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do you take of heed of ſlighting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or its Teſtimony; for therein you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit great injury to God, it being his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, and by him ſet in you.</p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:35177:142"/>
               <p n="2">2. It is great folly alſo to ſtop its mouth: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. All your hindering it, or endeavouring to do ſo, will but prove an aggravation of its Witneſs another day againſt you; then it will tell you, That it would have ſpoken plainly to you ſuch and ſuch a time, but you would not hear, you were ſo buſie in the World, or the like.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why Saints do no more rejoice, is, becauſe they walk no more in the teſtimony of their own conſciences.</p>
               <p>We were alſo exhorted in the concluſion to be very tender of doing any thing without a ſolemn Court of Conſcience; raſhneſs is the worſt evil; Conſcience is Gods Witneſs, let it be yours; give it full liberty therefore to ſpeak and ſay all it can; ask it again and again what it ſaith to this and that action, and may be it will give thee that Teſtimony that through raſhneſs and haſtineſs it had not time to ſpeak or thou to hear it.</p>
               <p>Oh what ſenſible hints were theſe to my poor ſoul, if the Lord would but pleaſe to bleſs them effectually to me, and help me to put them in practice daylie!</p>
               <p>The Lord having ſeen meet to call our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vilet</hi> ont of this World, I heard that he

               <p n="2">2. In regard of our not improvements of the diſcoveries made of our future eſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe their preſent eſtate is compaſſed with ſin and affliction, both vvhich do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ſight of this glory; but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the Reaſons why it doth not appear he ſhewed were theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the many diverſions of the Spirit of Saints, that turn them aſide from behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their glory to come; how do the toyes and baubles of this World divert them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of this? and ſo their eſtate doth not appear to them.</p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:35177:143"/>
               <p n="2">2. It comes from inconſtancie of Spirit, becauſe their hearts do not dwell on thoſe things; no man is excellent in that his heart and thoughts dwell not upon: ſo here</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the weakneſs of our Faith; for we live novv by Faith; but when Chriſt ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, then you ſhall live by ſight; ſo that whileſt you are here, your ſight is according to your Faith; if your Faith be right and ſtraight like <hi>Stephens,</hi> then have you a ſtrong ſight of glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It appears not, from the remainders of corruptions that abide in us; every ſin vails the ſight of this glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God himſelf is pleaſed ſometimes to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Saints not only under darkneſs in the ſight of their future eſtate, but alſo of their preſent eſtate; and ſo they walk in the dark; and this God doth for high and holy ends, and gives great inſtructions through it no his Saints to look up to him for life, and wait on him for the manifeſtation of his love and their future eſtate, and to make them ſee that it flows from nothing in them, but from him only; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life being not only the gift of God, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the light whereby we ſee it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This glory appears not to the World al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and that</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:35177:143"/>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the World ſees only the outſide of a godly man, his ſhell; but they ſee not the glory of his inſide; they ſee their poverty, and contempt, and reproach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they ſee not the glorious working of God on their ſouls, or operation of his ſpirit in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It appears not to the World, becauſe the Saints have their Clouds upon them: The beſt have their infirmities, and theſe the World look moſt upon; wicked men are blind and cannot ſee; for ſpiritual things muſt be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcerned; becauſe many times there are differences among the Saints themſelves; and this darkens their glory to the World who ſee them diſputing about Religion, and the like; the World judgeth of their future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate by their preſent condition; if men flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh here, then they judge well of them; if they lie under troubles, they judge them hated of God; and thus God ſuffers this darkneſs about their future eſtate,</p>
               <p>To humble his Saints, and make them cry to him for light.</p>
               <p>To manifeſt the ſincerity of the Saints.</p>
               <p>To ſet them a longing after Eternity, where they ſhall have full and cleare ſight.</p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:35177:144"/>
               <p>To make glory appear glory; indeed, if the glittering here be glorious, what ſhall the full be? that it appears no, is out of juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God to this wicked World, who do hate and contemn them; therefore God wil not let them ſee their glory; they ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know it by feeling the contrary, and the want of it.</p>
               <p>There were bleſſed diſcoveries given to judge our eſtate.</p>
               <p>We were alſo inſtructed in all our preſent afflictions in this World ſtill to remember it appears not yet what we ſhall be; did you keep your eye on this, how would it refreſh you under all troubles!</p>
               <p>Keep your eye then on Chriſt his appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for there your fulneſs ſhall be.</p>
               <p>But further to refreſh the Saints, they are at preſent the ſons of God, but know not the beſt of their eſtate; you may be now under clouds and temptations but the beſt is behind; <hi>it appears not now what you ſhall be:</hi> And let this chear up your hearts.</p>
               <p>The 8. day of this tenth month, the Lord drew out my heart in the morning, being the day of our Church-meeting, to beg of him to go forth with us this day, or elſe not to carry
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:35177:144"/> us out; and withal, That he would pleaſe to provide a bleſſed word, a ſeaſonable word for every poor ſoul that ſhould in the ſincerity of their ſpirit wait upon him that day; and that he would pleaſe to ſpeak ſome ſeaſonable word to my ſoul, that it may be a bleſſed teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that his preſence was with me, begging alſo the pouring out of his ſpirit richly on them he ſhould pleaſe to ſend to ſpeak among us, with much to this effect.</p>
               <p>The nineth of this tenth month, at night the Lord was pleaſed often to draw out my heart with ſome ſence of his appearances, as alſo my unfruitfulneſs under all former ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearancs, beſeeching him to ſanctifie all his appearances to my ſoul, and help me to walk more watchfully, and hearken more to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of my own conſcience in what ever I had done, and not to ſin againſt it, with many ſuch like deſires, begging this, That as he had ſo ſweetly encouraged my ſoul by theſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hints the third of this month, ſo that now he wovld pleaſe, notwithſtanding all my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs and unfruitfulneſs, yet to make good theſe gracious words of his, wherein he hath ſaid, <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over his people;</hi> and <hi>that he would bruiſe Satan under their
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:35177:145"/> feet, that he would never leave nor forſake them;</hi> for which gracious bleſſed word of his I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to plead with him this Evening, even upon the account of the full ſatisfaction the Lord Jeſus had made to him, that therefore theſe bleſſed words might be made good to my poor ſoul; as alſo on the behalf of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant our dear Paſtor, who the eighth of this eighth Month ſeemed exceeding ſad, which came with ſome power and ſenſe upon my heart at this time beſeeching the Lord if he had convinced him of any evil in him, that he would alſo work it out of him; and if there were any other oppreſſion upon his ſpirit which was known to him, that he would pleaſe to eaſe, refreſh, comfort and fit him for the great work he hath called him to; and alſo pour out his ſpirit upon him, that he might have a real and ſenſible ſight of the anſwers of thoſe deſires; and that the Lord would pleaſe to direct him what, and how to ſpeak, ſo as might be to the advantage of every of our ſouls, who ſincerely ſeek his face and preſence: And oh my ſoul! how graciouſlie did the Lord appear the next day, being his Sabbath, and gave in a gracious anſwer to theſe deſires, and gave forth far beyond them?</p>
               <p>The 10th. of this 10th. Month, being the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:35177:145"/> Lords Day, in the morning I ſought the Lord for his moſt ſpecial preſence in, and with me this day, that he would pleaſe to prepare a ſeaſonable uſeful word for my ſoul, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my heart to meet with him, that my ſoul might be enabled to bleſs and praiſe his Name for it; and that he would pleaſe ſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to appear, that it might be written among the rewards of his love; yea, that it might come into my ſoul, even as a ſpecial pledge of his love; yea, that he would pleaſe to pour out his ſpirit upon his ſervant, and appear ſo eminently through him, as that alſo he might be enabled to acknowledge it to his praiſe: And oh my ſoul! how richly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, and fully did the Lord anſwer all theſe deſires, yea every of them in particular, which were ſpread before him more at large then I am able to ſet down! and truly, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of them were much more large and full, in which the Lord bowed down greatly, even to the requeſts alſo, to do more abundantly then I could ask or think; and ſo he did begin even as ſoon I came to the Congregation, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling my heart with great joy and expectation of his mercy from him, even in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sermon; the Pſalm ſung was <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 23. on which my ſoul joyfullie ran out; and ſo both in Prayer and in Preaching how abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantlie
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:35177:146"/> did the Lord bow down and refreſh my poor ſpitit, and the ſpirit of our dear Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, who in a moſt ſolemn manner again and again bleſſed the Lord for his appearances both in the diſpenſation of the Word, &amp; alſo in the Lords Supper that was that day admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred The Scripture ſpoken to us was <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>Thou hateſt iniquity;</hi> whence he ſhewed, That Chriſt was lovely to his Saints for hating iniquity: In opening hereof he ſhewed us what hatred was in man, and what it was in Chriſt, which (as he ſaid) was not an action or paſſion, but his very nature and will, which putteth forth all his other Excellencies, as his Power and his Wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to repel all that is contrarie to his Nature and Will, which he further opened at large, ſhewing us, That all the object of Chriſts hatred was onely ſin, which is truly evil, men hate that which they apprehend evil; but Chriſts hatred is properly neither againſt men or Angels, but only againſt ſin, and man onlie as he is under the power of ſin; and this hatred maketh him repel that which he hateth with all his power, putting out all his Excellencies to the uttermoſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the deſtruction of ſin in us, or of us: Thus Chriſt loved the nature of man, and took it upon him; yet when this love was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:35177:146"/> into hatred by reaſon of the over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin, which fighteth againſt the life of Chriſt; and when this love of his comes to turn to hatred, the hatred is the greater. Now that Chriſt hateth ſin, appears both in the work of Redemption and Rejection: In the work of Redemption when he comes to ſuppreſs ſin in us, he ſeemeth by this action to ſpeak in this manner, Rather then ſin ſhall live in thee. I will dye: my blood ſhall rather go for it. So in the Rejection, the hatred of Chriſt ſhall kindle the fire of Hel about them: But that Chriſt doth thus hate ſin, appears further by theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his dealings againſt it in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Adam</hi> no ſooner made but he falls; and ſo boiling hot was Gods hatred againſt ſin, that before he gives him time for repentance, or any parley, he preſently goes to his poſterity, and paſſeth judgement upon him and them; Dying thou ſhalt dye, temporally, ſpiritually, and eternally; and there ſhall be enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy ſeed and the womans, that moſt of thy ſeed ſhall take in with Satan, and periſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally: How many millions periſh upon the account of that one ſin? So the Angels they fell preſently and irrecoverably, for that one ſin of pride, though ſuch glorious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:35177:147"/> who could do more then thouſands of men and might have been ſo uſeful to the Church, being ſpiritual, had they ſtood, who could immediately comfort when no other creatures could; yea, could have fed <hi>Eli ahs</hi> and <hi>Daniels;</hi> yet theſe for that ſin periſhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears by the way he taketh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it; ſin having gotten the Throne, and poor man brought into a periſhing condition by it, and not able to oppoſe it; now Chriſt hates it, ſo that the conteſt now comes between Chriſt and ſin, and he will dye to deſtroy it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It appears by the dreadfulneſs of the doom of thoſe that are over-powered by ſin, who are judged to eternal fite without pitty or recovery</p>
               <p>Then he came to ſhew us how lovely Chriſt is to the Saints for hating iniquitie.</p>
               <p>And O my ſoul! with what mighty power and weight did this fall upon thy heart? As</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſhewed us, That Chriſts lovelineſs in this attribute aroſe from the unanimity and one-neſs of mind between Chriſt and a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in this hatred of his; for as Chriſt hateth the ſin, but loveth the believer, ſo the believer hateth iniquitie, but loveth Chriſt; ſo that
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:35177:147"/> the love of both perſons center in one and their hatred in one, and their love meeteth in each others perſon, and their hatred alſo; and that Believers hate ſin. ſo that nothing can breed more love then this doth, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I hate Iniquity;</hi> oh therefore, hate it more ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, yea, purſue the life of it; and I appeal to the Lord if I do not hate it with a perfect hatred.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt is lovelie for hating ſin, becauſe this attribute ſetteth all his attributes on work againſt all the Enemies of a Believer; the poor ſoul hateth ſin, but is not able to deal with it: but Chriſt ſo hateth it, that he is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it: Oh what a bleſſed ſight of Chriſt is this! that though the poor ſoul be over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with ſin daylie, yet that Chriſt hateth it, and is engaed aginſt it, as hating of him: So that now either Chriiſt or it muſt periſh: Oh what a lovely ſight is this becauſe out of this hatred of Chriſt comes the ruine of the ſouls Enemies, Sin and Satan, which ſeek thy ruine daylie: But bleſſed be God, that Chriſt hateth them and will certainly ruine them! ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he or ſin muſt cown: Oh what comfort is this that we poor creatures have in Chriſt, that when we come even to ſtruggle with ſin and Satan, Chriſt like fire will conſume and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:35177:148"/> burn them? yea, as he ſhewed, this hatred was an act of Chriſts will; and if he hath not his Will, where is his God-head? Therefore the quarrel is between the Will of Chriſt, and the Will of ſin: I will damn thee to Hell, ſaith ſin and Satan: But I will kill thee, O ſin and Satan, ſaith Chriſt: ſo as the quarrel is not ſo much for Believers perſons, as for Chriſts Wil, and Chriſt will certainly have his wil: oh bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed word to my ſoul!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt is lovely in this, becauſe the Saints ſee the glory of all Chriſts other excellencies through this; the wicked ſee and fall at the dread of Chriſts hatred, but ſee not the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs of all Chriſts admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, as the Saints do; they can ſee the juſtneſs and righteouſneſs of Chriſt in damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men to Hell for ſin; yea, the Saints can behold Chriſts love to them in this hatred of ſin.</p>
               <p>This 10th. of this Moneth, being the ſame Lords day, in the Evening, while I was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to bleſs and praiſe the Name of this my glorious God, for his eminent appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this day, which I deſire never to forget, it fell upon my heart amongſt other things to tell the Lord, That ſeeing he had caſt ſuch a hint upon my heart, that the beſt thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:35177:148"/> for mercy received, is to gather in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for more mercy: I did therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, That to all his abundant appearances to my ſoul this day, he would pleaſe to adde this mercy, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I deſired to plead with him for this Evening, That as he had gloriouſly unvailed through his Word the hatred of my Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt againſt ſin, that he would now alſo ſhew its evil by experience, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that really he doth hate ſin, yea every ſin in my ſoul, by his purſuing the life, and drawing out the blood of it; telling him withal, That if any ſin were the object of the hatred of my ſoul, then needs muſt this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of mine in a ſpecial manner, being ſo diametrically oppoſite to him, as the ſetting up of any thing or creature in his Throne; yea even at this preſent wherein he hath ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly appeared, that the conſolations of God were not ſmall to my ſoul, they coming with ſuch mighty power, praying him in a ſpecial manner to purſue the body of this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and let my ſoul find, that really it is the object of the hatred of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall certainly be ruined by him.</p>
               <p>Having got a great cold which did ſomewhat diſtemper me, I was in a great queſtion whether
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:35177:149"/> I ſhould the twentieth of this tenth month go to the Ordinance or no; at laſt I deſired to give it up to the Lord, bſeeching him to direct me what to do, deſiring only to be led by him: At laſt I reſolved (God willing) to wait upon him this day at <hi>Fulham,</hi> and as for the next day, let the Lord do with me what he will, whether to fit me to go, or diſable me, having many fears upon my ſpirit concerning my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether it were a right and pure aiming at God, and ſeeking his preſence, yea or no, being not able to ſatisfie my ſelf in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>Thus (I ſay) deſiring the Lords appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to my ſoul, and ſpeaking ſome words to him for my ſpiritual advantage, I went this day to <hi>Fulham,</hi> where the Lord ſhewed me what a bleſſed thing it was to have a ſight of God from thoſe words in <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes that ſee the things you ſee; and the ears that hear the things you hear;</hi> whence the Lord ſhewed me what an abundant cauſe I had to bleſs him for them, thoſe many ſights he had given me of himſelf, when he had left ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the dark, and never given them one glimpſe of himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:35177:149"/>
               <p>But being exceeding ill and weary this night, I went to bed betimes, waiting what the Lord would do with me; and truly in the Morning I thought I found my ſelf unfit to go forth, conſidering alſo our meeting the next day, which haply the Lord might make me more fit to enjoy; yet I muſt needs ſay, I really think the trouble that lay upon my ſpirit about the ſtraightneſs of my ends in going, did more diſcourage me then the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my body; but what through the one and the other, I durſt not go forth this 21. day, and ſo my Mother and Aunt <hi>Dogget</hi> onely went, and I ſtayed at home; but when I aroſe, I found my ſelf pretty well, ſo as I begun to be ſomewhat troubled that I had ſtayed at home, fearing that this may be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſubtile device of Satan to hinder me of this opportunity; and ſo turning my ſelf to the Lord, I beſought him, that if it were he that had this day prevented me, that he would pleaſe to make it up to my ſoul ſome other way, by hinting out ſomething by his Spirit to my heart that might be for my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual advantage and truly, whiles I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to preſs this upon the Lord, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after there fell this apprehenſion upon my heart (or rather the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:35177:150"/> to to drop it) which was this: Oh Lord! how comes it to paſs that my ſoul being ſo exceedingly taken with any ſpark of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Image in poor mortal creatures ſhould at the preſent rebel and murmure at thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bleſſed will, which is part of thy eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial glory? if the ſight of thy image be ſo pleaſing to me, why then is not the ſight of thy will, which is thy ſelf, much more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the Rayes of thine that ſhine upon thy creatures? why is not this as pleaſing, as delightful, and contentful to me? which hint I could not but look upon as a real anſwer of this deſire, the Lord make it of uſe to me, I am ſure it was ſuch a confideration and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, that if the Lord will but pleaſe to ſet it home with power, may be of abundant advantage to my wicked ſpirit: The Lord in mercy for Chriſts ſake make it ſo.</p>
               <p>The 22. of this tenth month, being a day appointed for our Church-Meeting, I earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly beſought the Lord, That if he ſaw it meet to carry me forth this day, he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo go along with me, and vouchſafe his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence to me, in ſpeaking ſome ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable word to my poor ſoul that might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear even to come from himſelf; begging al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his preſence in and through all theſe his
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:35177:150"/> inſtruments, which he ſhould pleaſe to make uſe of this day.</p>
               <p>And O my ſoul, how gloriouſly was the Lord pleaſed to appear this day in chearing and refreſhing thy poor drooping ſpirit! e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo as thou wert not able to continue thy ſelfe in this wonderful appearance of God, caſting them upon ſo ſuteable a word, even to the eſtate of my poor ſoul at this preſent? and that Scripture our brother <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
